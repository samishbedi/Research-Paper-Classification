Abstract‚ÄîThe fast-paced development of power systems necessitates smart grids to facilitate real-time control and monitoring with
bidirectional communication and electricity Ô¨Çows. Future smart grids are expected to have reliable, efÔ¨Åcient, secured, and cost-effective
power management with the implementation of distributed architecture. To focus on these requirements, we provide a comprehensive
survey on different cloud computing applications for the smart grid architecture, in three different areas‚Äîenergy management,
information management, and security. In these areas, the utility of cloud computing applications is discussed, while giving directions
on future opportunities for the development of the smart grid. We also highlight different challenges existing in the conventional smart
grid (without cloud application) that can be overcome using cloud. In this survey, we present a synthesized overview of the current state
of research on smart grid development. We also identify the current research problems in the areas of cloud-based energy
management, information management, and security in smart grid.

1 INTRODUCTION
A smart grid is conceptualized as a combination of elec-
trical network and communication infrastructure.
With the implementation of bidirectional communication
and power Ô¨Çows, a smart grid is capable of delivering elec-
tricity more efÔ¨Åciently and reliably than the traditional
power grid. A smart grid consists of a power network with
‚Äòintelligent‚Äô entities that can operate, communicate, and
interact autonomously, in order to efÔ¨Åciently deliver elec-
tricity to the customers. This heterogeneity in architecture
of a smart grid motivates the use of advanced technology
for overcoming various technical challenges at different lev-
els. Any smart grid infrastructure should support real-time,
two-way communication between utilities and consumers,
and should allow software systems at both the producer
and consumer ends to control and manage the power usage
[1]. To manage millions of smart meters in secure, reliable,
and scalable ways, utilities must extend this communication
network management system to a distributed data center. In
this respect, cloud computing is envisaged to play key roles of
motivation in the design of the future smart grid. Cloud
computing is an emerging technology advocated for
enabling reliable and on-demand access to different com-
puting sources that can be quickly provisioned and released
in a cost-effective way to the service providers [2], [3]. Using
cloud infrastructure, a customer can gain access to their

1.1 Motivation
With the development of the state-of-the-art smart grid sys-
tems, it needs the support of bi-directional communication
facility, and processing of the information in real-time as
well. Additionally, energy demand from the users changes
dynamically in different time-periods (such as on-peak,
off-peak, and mid-peak), which in turn requires dynamic
availability of the communication facility (such as band-
width, processing units, and storage devices). Therefore,
there is a need to integrate a common platform with the
smart grid which is able to support the smart grid require-
ments as follows:
a) Energy management. The existing power grids need
optimal balancing of electricity demand and supply
between the customers and the utility providers [4]. Smart
grids are capable of addressing this requirement. Such
features in a smart grid is realized by the integration of
various energy management systems (EMS) such as home
energy management (HEM), demand side management
(DSM), and building energy management (BEMS) [5], [6].
A smart grid allows various renewable energy sources
(such as solar and wind) to have efÔ¨Åcient management of
supply and demand.
b) Need to support multiple devices in a common platform.
In a smart grid environment, multiple devices are imple-
mented. These multiple devices are home appliances,
smart meters, micro-grids, substations, sensor nodes, and
communication-network devices [7]. A suitable protocol
architecture needs to be implemented to support these
multiple devices in order to have reliable, and efÔ¨Åcient
electric supply.
c) Information management. Information management is an
important aspect in the smart grid architecture [8], [9]. In

deployed in the distribution sites. These smart meters gen-
erate massive data for real-time communication with the
utilities. A proper data management mechanism is neces-
sary to be deployed for handling such massive data.
d) Layered architecture. A smart grid is a combination of
different layers‚Äînetwork, communication, electricity distri-
bution, transmission, and generation [10]. The smart grid is
expected to support the overlay communication network on
the underlay electricity network.

ture is a special characteristic of a smart grid. Demand
response (DR), distributed generation, resource scheduling,
and real-time pricing model contribute to the heterogeneity
of a smart grid [11].
f) Security. Effective authentication and authorization
techniques are required for the preservation of users‚Äô pri-
vacy. Some security aspects in a smart grid are data outage,
threat detection, and cyber-physical attacks [12], [13]. A
proper privacy policy needs to be implemented to motivate
customers‚Äô participation [12], [14].
Additionally, cloud computing is a useful technique
which can fulÔ¨Åll the requirements of the smart grid in real-
time adequately, while having the following characteristics
[15], [16]:
 Optimizing energy costs enabling online monitoring
and control of all grid assets.

Providing different software applications to the
users in the smart grid (such as customers, service
providers, third parties) for supporting payment
according to energy consumption.
 Reduction in carbon emissions through grid access
of large wind, hydro, and solar power plants [17].
 Active management of demand and supply curves.


tomer data.

cloud.

1.2 Contribution
In this paper, we provide a systematic overview of inte-
grating cloud computing applications in smart grids, in
three aspects‚Äîenergy management, information management,
and security in the smart grid architecture. For energy
management in smart grid, different cloud computing
techniques proposed in the existing literature are dis-
cussed brieÔ¨Çy. Consequently, we discuss several issues to
apply the cloud computing techniques for energy man-
agement with some future research directions. On the
other hand, smart grid is the combination of electrical
and communication network. Therefore, communication
network plays an important role for reliable energy man-
agement. We discuss
the
information management
schemes for smart grid using cloud infrastructure. Addi-
tionally, we also discuss the security issues in smart grid
which can be addressed using cloud computing. Several
future research directions are explained in terms of
energy management, information management, and secu-
rity in smart grid. In summary, our objective in this paper
is to offer the following:

computing in terms of energy management, commu-
nication, and security.
2) A clear concept of cloud computing applications in
smart grid.
3) An identiÔ¨Åed list of key problems that can be over-
come using cloud applications.
Some future research directions in terms of cloud
applications in smart grid.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We give a
comprehensive overview of smart grid and cloud comput-
ing in Section 2. We brieÔ¨Çy describe the cloud computing
applications in the context of energy management in smart
grid in Section 3. In Section 4, we survey the application of
cloud computing for communication and information man-
agement systems. In Section 5, we address different security
aspects in smart grid, which can be overcome with the
implementation of cloud computing applications. Smart
grid with and without cloud-based applications are com-
pared in the context of some existing literature in Section 6.
Finally, a conclusion is provided in Section 7.

2 OVERVIEW OF SMART GRID AND CLOUD
COMPUTING
2.1 Smart Grid
A smart grid can be conceptualized as an integration of elec-
tric power grid with the bidirectional communication net-
work system [18]. With the integration of information and
communication technology, modern smart grid is capable
of providing electricity to the end users in an increasingly
efÔ¨Åcient manner. A smart grid architecture spans primarily
three different
technical domains‚Äîgeneration system,
transmission side, and distribution side [19]. The generation
side consists of traditional power plant generation. The
transmission side is responsible for delivering electricity to
the distribution side (customers). An important characteris-
tic of a smart grid is controlling electricity consumption
at the customers‚Äô ends by establishing different optimiza-
tion methods [20], [21]. To achieve this goal, smart metering
and micro-grid are the most important components that
have been incorporated in the smart grid architecture.
Smart metering. Smart metering is one of the most emerg-
ing technologies used in smart grid to obtain information
about customers‚Äô real-time energy consumption. It is also
capable of controlling the advanced metering infrastructure
(AMI) systems [22]. AMI is supported with bidirectional
communication mechanism to obtain real-time energy con-
sumption at the customers‚Äô ends remotely. A smart meter is
a device deployed at the distribution-end, and capable of
recording the energy consumption by the customers. Cus-
tomers and utilities are beneÔ¨Åted with smart metering infra-
structure. For example, a customer can estimate his/her
energy consumption during the whole day for cost-optimi-
zation, and utility is able to maintain real-time monitoring
for the supply-demand curve.
Micro-grid. In the concept of the smart grid architecture,
the power distribution side is divided into subgroups simi-
lar to the step-down transformers. These subgroups have
self-generation capacity such as combined heat power,
wind generation, and solar generation. Additionally, they

storage systems.

can control and distribute electricity to the end-users. These
subgroups are known as micro-grids. A micro-grid is the
integration of low-voltage electricity systems with self-gen-
erating facilities. A subgroup has an independent power
supply and control system to provide electricity to the end
users [23], [24]. In the presence of an intrusion in the entire
system, a micro-grid acts in the islanding mode. In such a
situation, a micro-grid is able to control the power Ô¨Çow
autonomously. Due to the Ô¨Çuctuation in renewable energy
sources, the primary distributed energy resources are con-
verted into distributed generation using the micro-grid
operation. Some of the advantages of a micro-grid are listed
as follows:

1)

3)

Electricity distribution facility is converted to decen-
tralized from centralized.
2) A micro-grid increases the local reliability, and
energy management mechanisms.
Improved real-time monitoring system can be
achieved.
In the presence of any kind of intrusion, it acts in the
islanding mode, and supplies electricity in secure
and efÔ¨Åcient ways to the end users.
5) All the micro-grids can interact with one another
and exchange energy, when there is an excess or
deÔ¨Åcit of it.
Fig. 1 illustrates a smart grid architecture with the gener-
ation, transmission, and distribution components. The tradi-
tional power plants, and renewable energy sources are
treated as generation side of a smart grid. Electricity is
transmitted to the distribution side from the generation side
using transmission lines. Finally, the distribution side is
responsible for distributing it to the end users.

2.2 Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is an emerging computation model that
provides on-demand facilities, and shared resources over
the Internet. Cloud computing, based on large storage and
computational devices, acts as a utility provider [25], [26].
Cloud computing provides three distinct types of services‚Äî
Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) [3], [27], [28].
Infrastructure as a service. IaaS is the infrastructure service
model that includes storage and virtual machines. Load bal-
ancing in cloud computing is performed using IaaS. Users
can install access to required software through virtual
machines. These virtual devices provide on-demand facility

to the customers [17], [29], [30]. The IaaS service offers hard-
ware platform to the users on-demand basis. Therefore,
users can access the online hardware platform as on-demand
basis to fulÔ¨Åll their requirements. Additionally, the IaaS ser-
vice also supports vertualization of resources on which a
guest user can run his/her own operating system [29].
Platform as a service. PaaS is responsible for the develop-
ment and delivery of programming models to IaaS. Users
can access such programming models through cloud and
execute their programs [29]. PaaS is responsible for the run-
time execution of users‚Äô given task. Therefore, the PaaS ser-
vice completes the requirements of building and delivering
of Web-applications without downloading and installing
required software as well.
Software as a service. SaaS supports all the applications in
the cloud environment. This feature of cloud computing is
accessible through Web-browsers. The SaaS service provides
the modeling of software deployment where users can run
their applications without installing it on his/her own com-
puter. However, this service is limited to the users, i.e., only
existing set of services is available to the customers.
On the other hand, cloud can also be categorized,
depending on the deployment models, as‚Äîprivate, public,
community, and hybrid [3].


Private cloud. The cloud is owned by a private organi-
zation, and information is shared only within the
organization. The purpose of this type of cloud
application is to serve its own business applications.
Public cloud: On the other hand, public cloud is
owned by a service provider, and used by public for
their purposes.
 Community cloud. Community cloud is similar to the
private cloud with some additional features to pro-
vide services to a group of organizations who have
similar type of requirements.
 Hybrid cloud. Hybrid cloud is the extension of cloud
computing with private, public, and community
cloud computing techniques [28]. The private, pub-
lic, and community clouds are integrated together to
perform several tasks which are capable of handling
the requirements of private, public, and community
organizations.
In Fig. 2, cloud services and properties are shown. Addi-
tionally, we also show the categorization of cloud comput-
ing application in Fig. 3. The advantages of using a cloud
computing model are as follows [31], [32], [33], [34]:

nature of storage and memory devices. It can expand

and reduce itself according to the demand from the
users, as needed.
Shared architecture. Cloud computing also supports
shared architecture.
Information can be shared
among the users after meeting the privacy issues,
and, thereby, reducing service costs [35].
 Metering architecture. Cloud computing offers meter-
ing infrastructure to customers [36]. In the metering
system, cost optimization mechanisms are offered to
users, enabling them to provision and pay for their
consumed resources only.
Internet services. Cloud computing can be imple-
mented in the existing Internet service system. Thus,
it supports the existing network infrastructure.

3 CLOUD APPLICATIONS FOR ENERGY
MANAGEMENT

Energy management is a major concern in smart grid envi-
ronments. In the past several years, researchers addressed
this issue by incorporating the implementation of different
components such as Home Energy Management System
(HEMS), building energy management system, dynamic
pricing, and load shifting [37]. Therefore, the objective of
the smart grid is to support cost-effective and reliable
energy management in real-time. In this section, we provide
a brief overview of the application of cloud computing for
smart grid energy management. First, we address different
problems using existing approaches for energy manage-
ment without cloud applications in smart grid. Then, we
discuss how these problems can be undertaken with the
implementation of cloud computing. Finally, we conclude
this section while proposing some future research directions
on various aspects of cloud applications for smart grid.

3.1 Problems with Existing Approaches without
Cloud
The heterogeneous architecture of smart grids, demand
response, and micro-grids are the main building blocks in
the smart grid architecture.
Demand response. In smart grid, stand-by generators are
used in order to support the heavy load in on-peak hours.
These generators are typically based on fossil fuels, and,
thus, they increase carbonization of the environment. There-
fore, implementation of virtual energy sources are useful
than the physical ones. This mechanism is known as
Demand Response‚Äîa mechanism by which the customers
can actively participate in balancing the supply and
demand curves [38],
[39].
In the presence of demand

applications.

response mechanism, customers can schedule their applian-
ces during off-peak hours to minimize the energy consump-
tion cost, which in turn minimizes the load on the micro-
grids during on-peak hours. Customers can take adequate
decision while they have grid, storage, and self-generated
energy as well to minimize the energy cost with the help of
demand response mechanism. On the other hand, virtual
energy storage is also one of the useful techniques for reli-
able energy supply. In the presence of virtual energy storage
platform, the micro-grids can store their excess energy,
while other micro-grids can consume the storage energy to
fulÔ¨Åll their customers‚Äô demand.
In Fig. 4a, a conceptual view of the conventional smart
grid (without cloud) is shown, where customers are ser-
viced by micro-grids. A micro-grid has some self-generation
unit such as solar, and wind generation. All the different
components (substations, micro-grids, and customers) can
communicate with utility providers over the communica-
tion network. On the other hand, in Fig. 4b, the integration
of cloud applications in the smart grid architecture is
shown. The cloud applications can be served as virtual
energy storage [40], and data storage devices. In such a sce-
nario, smart grid components communicate with the cloud
instead of doing so with one another directly, and taking
necessary decisions for energy management.
In the conventional smart grid architecture (without
cloud), several problems, as detailed below, are addressed
by researchers [31], [32], [33], [41], [42].



The master-slave architecture causes extensive expo-
sure to cyber attacks such as the distributed denial-
of-service (DDoS) attack from the compromised
nodes in the demand response model [31]. In such
master-slave architecture, the utility provider acts as
a master and the customers act as slaves.
Single failure in master-slave architecture is one of
the biggest concerns in the existing approaches in
which cloud is not used.

The maximum number of customers that can be
served is limited due to the limited server capacity.
 Demand response is performed in an utility‚Äôs energy
management systems (EMS). As limited memory
and storage are available, it will be a challenging
problem for energy management when the number
of customers increases.
 Adequate management and control
is necessary,
while a micro-grid provides services in islanded
mode, as different issues (such as stability and voltage
regulation) are to be met by the micro-grid itself [42].
In the conventional approaches(without cloud),
using sensor nodes and intelligent devices, an early
warning system can be integrated with the grid.
However, due to limited energy and bandwidth
resources, real-time implementation is quite difÔ¨Åcult.
These are some of the fundamental issues with the exist-
ing approaches in the smart grid architecture, as reported in
the literature [31], [32], [33], [41], [42].

proposed two smart grid related issues: (a) peak demand
and (b) dynamic pricing. With the integration of cloud,
requests from customers are scheduled which are to be exe-
cuted depending on the available resources, priority, and
other applicable constraints. During peak hours, the mes-
sages from smart meters are more than those in the non-
peak hours [32]. However, in such a scenario, incoming jobs
from users are scheduled according to their priority, avail-
able resources, and applicable constraints. With the integra-
tion of dynamic bandwidth allotment mechanism using
cloud application, these issues can be addressed conve-
niently. During the peak-hour, the allotted bandwidth is
higher than that in the non-peak hour, so as to serve all the
incoming jobs simultaneously.
Virtualization is one of the most efÔ¨Åcient techniques for
cost reduction, resource optimization, and server manage-
ment [41]. Cloud computing can be implemented in the
form of different strategies of the micro-grids. Rajeev and
Ashok [41] proposed a framework for integrating cloud
computing applications for micro-grid management in the
form of different modules such as infrastructure, power
management, and service. The infrastructure and power
management modules are used for task scheduling and
micro-grid power management, respectively. The different
operators publish their service description using the service
module. With the implementation of cloud computing, the
external computing devices can be integrated with the inter-
nal ones. Thus,
the number of supported customers
increases, as suggested by Rajeev and Ashok [41]. In such a
manner, integrating virtual energy sources with the existing
energy storage devices, and the energy exchange mecha-
nism can be achieved among the micro-grids to meet the
energy requirements from consumers.
The smart grid infrastructure needs to be deployed glob-
ally. Scalable software platform is needed in order to rap-
idly integrate and analyze information streaming from
multiple smart meters simultaneously, in order to balance
the real-time demand and supply curves. Yang et al. [33]
advocated that cloud platforms are well suited to support
such huge data and computationally-intensive, always-on
applications. In such applications, scalable requirements of
resources are offered by the cloud applications to build a
software infrastructure to support such dynamic and
always-on applications. In these environments, cloud plat-
forms work as intrinsic components due to the diverse bene-
Ô¨Åts they offer, as mentioned below:

3)

1) Cloud acts elastically to avoid costly capital invest-
ment by the utility during the peak hours.
2) Real-time energy usage and pricing information can
be shared, so that the customers can get beneÔ¨Åted
from the real-time information.
Some data can be shared with a third party by using
cloud services, after meeting the data privacy poli-
cies for developing intelligent applications to cus-
tomize consumer needs.
The implementation of specialized data abstraction for data
streams generated from the different components is one of
the key technologies for real-time monitoring to take deci-
sions at different instances. On the other hand, third-party
vendors are allowed to participate in such real-time

3.2 Solution Concept with Cloud Applications
For several years, researchers proposed several solution
concepts for demand response and micro-grid management
[31], [32], [33], [41], [43], [44], [45].
Kim et al. [31] proposed the concept of Cloud-Based
Demand Response (CDR) for fast response times in large
scale deployment. In this architecture, the master/slave
demand response model is proposed, in which the smart
meters and the home EMS act as slaves, and the utility
acts as the master. In such a scenario, the CDR leverages
data-centric
communication, publisher/subscriber
and
topic-based group management, instead of IP-centric com-
munication. Two cloud-based demand response models are
proposed as follows: (a) data-centric communication and
(b) topic-based group communication. Secure, scalable and
reliable demand response can be achieved by using the
CDR approach. However, the demand-response model dis-
cussed in [31] has an overhead problem with the implemen-
tation of private cloud for a small-sized network. Some of
the overhead problems are the implementation cost, and
the selection of appropriate strategy. Even for a small-sized
network, all the features of cloud computing platform
should be supported in order to have reliable, and secure
electricity distribution in a smart grid, and, thus, implemen-
tation cost of cloud applications is higher than the existing
methods for a small-sized network. So, there is a need for
developing such a demand-response model using cloud-
based applications that will facilitate both the large and
small-scale network.
Energy management can also be addressed with the
implementation of dynamic pricing. Xuan Li and Lo [32]

monitoring system. So, deÔ¨Åning an effective privacy-policy
is perceived to be a secure mechanism, while allowing the
third-party vendors for the real-time monitoring process.
Cloud-based services are used for communication and
management schemes in the smart grid by Ji et al. [43],
while providing the facility of power monitoring and early-
warning system as well. In such a scenario, service-oriented
architecture (SOA) and enterprise service bus (ESB) are
used for providing the real-time support. In this approach,
Ô¨Çexible, efÔ¨Åcient, on-demand, and scalable smart grid
power monitoring system can be built. The authors pro-
posed that SOA relies on publishing applications as a ser-
vice. Standard Web services, interfaces, service registry,
service Ô¨Ånding, and service access are implemented into a
single cloud application using SOA. With the implementa-
tion of cloud applications, resource management, task man-
agement, and security management activities can be
performed using the ESB architecture for smart grid energy
management [43].
With the fast development of smart grid, implementation
of higher storage and processing capacity of power system
is needed. In such a scenario, a mobile agent is used to serve
the information interaction mechanism in the cloud com-
puting infrastructure [44] to fulÔ¨Åll the requirements of the
smart grid. This mobile agent combined with cloud comput-
ing acts as an intermediate device among different levels in
the smart grid. Different types of mobile agents such as
Data Mobile Agent (DMA) and State Mobile Agent (SMA)
can cooperate with one another to fulÔ¨Åll users‚Äô requests.
The work in [44] proposes that the use of a mobile agent is
more suitable for power system using cloud computing
platform due to the smart grid‚Äôs heterogeneous architecture.
In the smart grid architecture, multiple users as well as mul-
tiple energy sources participate together. In the conven-
tional smart grid system (without integrating cloud), an
energy source with multiple user energy consumption units

(agents) is studied by Rad et al. [46]. Using this mobile
agent, it is important to understand how energy information
interaction can be done while considering multiple users
and sources.
In a recent paper [45], cloud computing is used as Soft-
ware as a Service for smart grid cyber-physical systems. In
this work, the authors discussed about dynamic demand
response (D2R) to perform intelligent demand-side man-
agement and relieve peak-load. In such a scenario, D2R acts
as an intelligent decision making tool to increase the reli-
ability of smart grid. In such a model, the implementation
of a cloud-based software platform is envisioned to be use-
ful to support all the portable devices of different layers in a
smart grid. The advantages of dynamic demand response
(D2R) are as follows:
 Demand is periodically forecasted.
 According to the demand and supply information,
proper strategy is selected in order to achieve a reli-
able and efÔ¨Åcient smart grid architecture.
We present the comparison of different cloud-based
applications for smart grid energy management in Table 1
using different features of a smart grid, as addressed by the
authors in [31], [32], [33], [41], [43], [44], [45].
Further, in Table 2, we present a summary of different
energy management mechanisms, as suggested by the
authors [31], [32], [33], [41], [43], [44], [45], with some direc-
tions for future research.

3.3 Future Research Directions with Some
Research Challenges
Cloud computing applications are one of the most useful
techniques for the future smart grid development. Beyond
the previously discussed cloud applications, various future
opportunities for cloud-based energy management are dis-
cussed below with some of the research challenges.

Implementation of private cloud computing applica-
tions for smart grid that will support small-size net-
works. In such a scenario, a group of users is served
by the private cloud, which improves the privacy pre-
serving smart grid architecture. However, it is also a
challenging issue to support such multiple small-size
network due to their heterogeneous activities.
It is useful to give Ô¨Çexibility to the micro-grids to
operate with/without
the real-time information.
Therefore, exchanging energy information between
cloud and micro-grid is a big challenge, though
micro-grid acts in the islanded mode. In the presence
of
intrusion, allowing islanded micro-grids
to
exchange energy from/to the cloud energy storage
device is an important issue.
Introducing cloud energy devices
to maintain
demand and supply curve during peak hours. How-
ever, there is no well-established framework that
will support the virtual energy storage systems.
Therefore, proposing a framework that will support
such a virtual energy storage device is a research

challenge, while allowing all the entities (in the
smart grid) to take part of this.
Similar to the above, allowing electricity exchange
from micro-grid to cloud energy device and vice-
versa can reduce the variation of supply-demand
curve, when there is an access and deÔ¨Åcit of
energy, respectively. Therefore, online and real-
time optimization, planning, prediction, and con-
trol of energy management for future smart grid
using cloud applications is a trivial task without
adequate infrastructure.
Introducing a virtual power Ô¨Çow controller for
reliable and efÔ¨Åcient smart grid operation. The
optimization of power Ô¨Çow is one of the key tech-
nologies in smart grid [47]. A power Ô¨Çow control-
ler is responsible for optimized electricity Ô¨Çow in
the islanded micro-grids. There is a need for devel-
oping an optimized power Ô¨Çow controller that will
work in any mode such as the normal mode, and
the islanded mode, and also in the presence of any
Ô¨Çuctuating power generation equipment.

Integrating PHEVs with cloud energy storage to
relieve the demand from micro-grids. During peak
hour, charging of PHEVs increases the load on smart
grid [48], [49]. In such a scenario, customer has to
pay high price for charging their PHEVs. With the
implementation of cloud energy storage services this
issue can be effectively addressed.

4 CLOUD APPLICATIONS FOR COMMUNICATION
AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

As we have seen in the preceding sections, a smart grid con-
sists of bidirectional electrical as well as communication
Ô¨Çows, primarily enabled with the help of advanced sensor
network technology. The smart meters are also deployed at
the customers‚Äô end to communicate with the service pro-
vider in order to exchange real-time information. Due to
this architecture, massive data are generated from both the
utility and end-users sides. The management of vast amount
of such data is challenging using the traditional data man-
agement approaches due to the different constraints (such
as processing unit storage, and memory). Consequently,
cloud computing applications are one of the best methods
to control such vast data in order to have a reliable, robust,
and efÔ¨Åcient smart grid environment [50], [51], [52].

4.1 Need for Cloud Applications for Information
Management
In a typical city environment, millions of smart meters are
deployed at the distribution side. To successfully handle
such massive data, a useful technique is required. Cloud
computing is such a useful technology for smart grid infor-
mation management due to the following reasons:


The requirements of information processing in smart
grid Ô¨Åt well with the computing and storage mecha-
nisms available for cloud applications.
In a smart grid, information sharing is one of the most
important issues. Information from different compo-
nents, and the supply and demand state conditions
can be shared with the help of cloud computing.
Shared information is accessible to the micro-grids,
end-users, and utilities, though they function in the
islanded mode.
 Management of massive data is complex, costly, and
may be beyond the capacity of existing data manage-
ment systems in the smart grid.
Using a cloud-based information management system can
help in encountering such drawbacks.





4.2 Information Management Using Cloud
Applications
Several works are proposed to improve communication
delays, thereby attempting to enable real-time communica-
tion through cloud data management in smart grid [53],
[54], [55], [56], [57], [58]. Towards this goal of data manage-
ment, Lv et al. [53] proposed a cloud data warehouse appli-
cation in smart grid. Formally, the authors deÔ¨Åned a cloud
data warehouse model in terms of extract transform load
(ETL), online analytical processing (OLAP), data mining
(DM), and business intelligence (BI) report technologies.

Fig. 5. A schematic view of smart grid communication with cloud data-
warehouse.

This cloud data warehouse architecture provides different
services for smart grid information management such as
multi-dimensional data analysis, and data mining [53]. In
multi-dimensional data analysis, the users have different
rules for energy consumption. However, it is required to
build a software platform using cloud data-warehouse for
proving services to the customers as a whole. The mecha-
nisms of coordination between a smart grid and cloud data-
warehouse need to be addressed in the future.
Fig. 5 depicts the schematic view of the cloud data ware-
house for smart grid, where the warehouse acts as data
storage for all the components such as smart meters, micro-
grids, utilities, and substations. A cost-optimization tech-
nique using cloud based architecture is presented by
Fang et al. [54], in order to have simple and economical infor-
mation management for smart grid. The work proposed dif-
ferent domains (such as smart grid, network, cloud, and
broker) for cost effective information management. The bro-
ker domain acts as a programming module to support the
optimization method as per the demand. However, in such a
scenario, deÔ¨Åning proper cloud-based data models for sup-
porting the heterogeneous architecture is to be strengthened.
With the implementation of cost-optimized information
sharing, electric vehicles such as the plug-in electric vehicles
(PHEV) can be beneÔ¨Åted. PHEV owners can access the real-
time price, the real-state of the smart grid, and can accord-
ingly charge and discharge their vehicles. In such a method,
the utility is also able to know where most of the PHEVs are
situated, and how much energy is required. The overall
cost-optimization method in terms of computation and stor-
age is studied for the smart grid architecture [54].
The cloud data center is used as communication and infor-
mation optimization components to support cognitive radio-
based AMI meters in a smart grid. The home area network
(enabled with Zig-bee, and Bluetooth) is supported with the
implementation of an optimization algorithm in the cloud
data center. A net-AMI for micro-grid infrastructure is pro-
posed using the cognitive radio network in the cloud data
center [55]. PHEV can be supported using the net-AMI infra-
structure, as it supports the cellular technology. The main
advantage of this net-AMI technology is that it can be inte-
grated with the existing BTS cellular service with the help of
cloud computing [55]. In such an infrastructure, the net-AMI
does not support the Ethernet protocols. So, deÔ¨Åning a cloud-
based proprietary protocol for cloud computing is needed to

support such protocols, while ensuring that they can work in
the presence of radio-waves in the smart grid environments.
A smart meter is a key component in the smart grid
architecture, and it supports two-way communication. For
large-scale development, millions of smart meters are
deployed in the distribution side. To successfully retrieve
massive data from smart meters, the cloud technology is
useful [56]. Lohrman and Kao [56] used cloud as Infrastruc-
ture as a Service for the processing of smart meter data
streams. The Nephele Execution Engine framework is used for
processing the smart meter data given in [56]. In such soft-
ware platforms, communication latency and processing
rates can be improved in order to have a real-time monitor-
ing system in the smart grid.
Real-time distributed data management and parallel
processing of information can be utilized using smart grid
data cloud application, as discussed in [57]. In such smart
grid data cloud scenario, cloud computing is used as Plat-
form as a Service. In the smart grid data cloud infrastructure,
cost and data management are shared. Due to the Ô¨Çexibility
of cloud computing, information is retrieved from the data
cloud more conveniently [57]. In the existing smart grid sys-
tem, a dynamic pricing model is used depending on the
load on micro-grids [59]. A dynamic pricing model can be
established according to the load on cloud data services. In
such a scenario, during peak-hour, load on data-cloud is
high, and, thus, real-time price will be more, and vice-versa.
Cloud computing services are used as a dynamic data
centers to store the real-time information from the smart
meters [60]. In such a scenario, the cloud-based data centers
are served as Internet data centers (IDC) which are available
to the customers through the Internet. The real-time pricing
policy is also presented as a non-linear function depending
on the load on the data center.
Table 3 presents a list showing comparisons of cloud-
based information management in the smart grid architec-
ture. Different applications support different cloud services
such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, as shown in the Table.
In Table 4, we summarize different cloud-based applica-
tions for smart grid information management, while giving
a few research directions [53], [54], [55], [56], [57].

4.3 Future Research Directions with Some
Research Challenges
The heterogeneous architecture of a smart grid allows huge
amount of data that are generated form smart meters, and,
thus, cloud computing applications are useful for managing
these data. However, there are some research challenges in
smart grid, while incorporating the cloud computing appli-
cations as follows.

1)

2)

Integration of public cloud with the private cloud
infrastructure for cost-effective communication in
smart grid. Public cloud can be integrated with the
private cloud for large-scale development in smart
grid in a cost-effective manner. However, security
and privacy are two of the important issues, while
allowing information exchange between private and
public cloud.
Similar to the energy scheduling, data trafÔ¨Åc sched-
uling can also be the important one to maintain ade-
quate data trafÔ¨Åc rate in the smart grid and cloud
environment. Consequently, with the help of data
trafÔ¨Åc scheduling technique, cyber-physical system
will also be established in order to maintain the pri-
vacy of the users.
3) Use of multi-mobile agent combined with cloud
computing for proÔ¨Åtable smart grid operation. Due
to heterogeneous communication architecture [11] of
smart grid, multi-mobile agent can be used to com-
municate with different layers. Therefore, deÔ¨Åning
an adequate mobile strategy for the agent is required
for cost-effective information management in the
smart grid. Otherwise,
it will be cost-expensive
rather than the cost-effective one.
Interactive cooperation using cloud services to support
not only multiple customers, but also multiple energy
sources for large-scale development of smart grid for
energy management, as discussed in Section 3.
5) Development of a cloud network, in which smart
elements can improve their delay by changing their
chosen path. On the other hand, it is also men-
tioned in [62] that smart elements cannot improve

their delays by changing their chosen path. There-
fore, it is also a challenging task to improve the
delay incurred by the smart meters using cloud
computing applications.
The key concept of smart grid is decentralized power
delivery with the existing centralized infrastructure
[63]. Development of cloud computing protocol
architecture will support distributed nature of the
smart grid. Therefore, enhancement of active partici-
pation by customers using cloud services, so that the
customers get reliable, and cost-effective services
such as billing.
7) Cloud computing can be used to recover network
failures. Due to failures in one of the protocol suites
used for communication,
the entire system is
affected in the smart grid technologies, as discussed
by Wang and Khanna [64].
8) Using cloud data warehouse, as in [53], for optimiza-
tion, control, and secure communication for the vir-
tual power plant (VPP) technology.

5 CLOUD APPLICATIONS FOR SECURITY IN SMART
GRID

A smart grid can be conceptualized as a cyber-physical
system that connects physical electricity systems and
cyber-infrastructure, with the integration of the Internet.
This service can communicate with the consumer applian-
ces and also provide the backbone for service providers to
absorb contents and control operations. With the presence
of online connectivity, it is a big challenge to prevent

cyber-attacks in the smart grid that can potentially disrupt
the power supply [65]. One of the important issues is
power theft by consumers. This can be done by hacking a
smart meter or modifying the real-time information
through accessing communication channel to change the
reported electricity usage. Additionally, data manipula-
tion is also one of the most security concerns in the smart
grid. To overcome these issues we need to implement
proper security for secure and reliable smart grid architec-
ture. Security can be implemented on the consumer side,
transmission side, and generation side. The main security
aspects of smart grid are as follows:
 With the increase of the grid system complexity and
their integration, it is difÔ¨Åcult to track interactions
among business systems securely.
The smart grid architecture is more complex than
the one for the traditional power grid. The imple-
mentation of a smart sensor network, wireless
communication, and smart meters increases the
complexity in the protection of the information
security system.
 With the implementation of millions of smart meters,
the network is distributed to the end-user systems.
So, the capacity of the protection at the end-users
needs further enhancement.

The denial-of-service (DoS) attack to affect the stabil-
ity of the applications for the smart grid.
 Utility and third-party can access the user data as
well as private information, thereby affecting the
privacy of the users.

Fig. 6. Main security aspects in smart grid architecture.

In Fig. 6, we show the main security issues in the smart
grid architecture. Data outage prevention, data manage-
ment, and users‚Äô privacy are important issues. Additionally,
Fig. 7 shows the interactions between different components
of smart grid and cloud computing. Only authorized smart
grid components can access different cloud services for pro-
viding adequate security to the end-users.

1. Data leakage. Data outage can be introduced inten-
tionally or unintentionally. In the presence of cyber-
physical attack, unintentional data leakage can be
performed by third-party. Even data outage can take
place with the help of user for her facility, and is
known as intentional data leakage.
2. Data management. The choice between data to be dis-
carded and the one to be stored is a major concern.
Proper data management mechanism is needed for
real-time state monitoring. With the integration of
proper Ô¨Åltering method, data can be managed
properly.
Privacy. Privacy preserving is one of the most impor-
tant issues in smart grid infrastructure. Due to the
lack of privacy policies, users‚Äô personal data can be
disclosed to the utility and also to third party vendors.
A proper authentication, and authorization process
needs to be implemented for securing users‚Äô privacy.

5.1 Different Security Technologies in Smart Grid
Using Cloud Applications
The existing information protection systems for electric
power are deÔ¨Åcient in handling the ever changing and
growing nature of security threats [66]. To address these
issues in the smart grid development, researchers proposed
several security technologies in terms of cloud computing
applications [66], [67], [68], [69], [70].
An electric power information security and protection
system, based on cloud security, is presented by Yanliang
et al. [66]. The authors classiÔ¨Åed cloud security into two
parts: server and client. The clients mainly collect data and
take action according to the server responses. On the con-
trary, the server uses the cloud computing platform to
implement the distributed storage, thereby acting as an
intelligent decision maker. Then the results are transmitted
to the clients through the Internet.
Simmhan et al. [67] analyzed different security and pri-
vacy issues in smart grid software architecture operating on
different cloud environments. Private cloud platforms are

suitable for scaling out and processing millions of data from
users. Using the cloud computing platform, the electrical
utilities can quickly and effectively deal with malicious soft-
ware, thereby reducing the overall network damage control
costs and improving the overall safety level.
The distributed veriÔ¨Åcation protocol (DVP) proposed by
Ugale et al. [68] is focused on guaranteeing data storage
security in cloud computing. The authors introduced the
merits of the application Ô¨Åeld of cloud computing to reduce
users‚Äô cost in the smart grid architecture. Ugale et al. [68]
also proposed that the implementation of the DVP protocol
is suitable to support data storage and power management
mechanisms for smart grid.
With the construction of power cloud technology for
smart grid development, many security issues are
addressed in [69]. Cloud computing expands the trust
boundary, and makes more stakeholders to join the adop-
tion of the traditional security techniques. Several cloud
computing security risks are discussed. For
instance,
(a) administrator being able to access personal sensitive
data, and (b) the location of the cloud required to ensure
that information is transmitted and kept securely.
Maheswari et al. [70] focused on the development of a
cloud-based software platform for state estimation in a
smart grid environment. With the implementation of the
public key infrastructure (PKI), issues related to fault-toler-
ance and intrusion detection are addressed. This state esti-
mation method utilizes maximum bandwidth that
is
available in the cloud, so as to achieve reliable, secure, and
fault-tolerant smart grid architecture. This software plat-
form also maximizes the use of cores.
Wen et al. [71] propose a privacy preserving smart meter-
ing scheme in the smart grid. In the proposed scheme, each
individual smart meter stores the real-time information in
encrypted form on the cloud platform. Therefore, only the
authorized entities are permissible to access the stored data.
In such a scenario, users can generate data query upto a pos-
sible range. Further, the query is transferred into two query
tokens which are used to Ô¨Ånd the required data, while main-
taining the users‚Äô privacy.
In Table 5, the comparison of different security aspects in
smart grid using cloud applications is shown. The different
smart security features‚Äîcyber-physical, data security and
privacy, and threat detection are compared.

1488

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 5, MAY 2015

TABLE 5
Comparison of Cloud Computing Applications for Smart Grid Security

In Table 7, we synthesize the different security tech-
nologies adopted in the smart grid architecture using
cloud applications, as proposed by the authors in [66],
[67], [68], [69], [70], with some future extensions. Yan-
gling et al. [66] proposed the server-client mechanism
for securing smart grid, as discussed earlier. In such a
mechanism, cloud can be used as SaaS for ensuring data
privacy issues to motivate customers to be part of the
smart grid.
Simmhan et al. also proposed a cloud-based software
platform to deal with security and privacy issues to prevent
malicious software attacks [67]. However, in such a soft-
ware platform, public cloud computing is used. So, strong
privacy policies need to be formulated while allowing the
use of public cloud applications.
The distributed veriÔ¨Åcation protocol is proposed for data
storage security in cloud applications for smart grid [68].
The DVP mechanism can be used for preventing intentional
or unintentional data-leakage.

Yang et al. [69] discussed some technical security issues
in power-cloud computing. With the technical security
issues, the non-technical issues such as the improvement
service of quality can also be addressed.
The real-time state estimation method is proposed by
Maheshwari et al. [70] using cloud applications. This cloud-
based state estimation method can be used for target-ori-
ented security technologies to track the location of electricity
theft for smart grid development.
A cloud-based range query information access mecha-
nism is proposed by Wen et al. [71]. The proposed method
is useful to maintain the privacy of the users, while using a
common platform (cloud) as a storage device. Therefore,
the proposed cloud-based is useful to handle the issues of
supporting multiple entities in a common platform, while
maintaining the security and privacy of the users as well.
In Table 6, we present a summary of the existing cloud-
based smart grid security technologies with some future
research directions.

5.2 Future Research Directions with Some
Research Challenges
Beyond the previously discussed cloud applications in
order to provide security in the smart grid, various future
opportunities for cloud-based security are also provided
with some research challenges.

1)

2)

In smart grid, third parties are also allowed to partic-
ipate in the real-time monitoring systems. Cloud
computing applications are expected to provide ade-
quate security to maintain the privacy of the users
data. However, it is still not clear from the existing
technologies that how this security can be provided,
while allowing third parties to take part into the sys-
tems. Therefore, providing cloud security to prevent
outage (third party vendors) to interact with the cus-
tomers equipment to control and monitor [72], while
allowing different vendors.
Implementing coordinated fault protection mecha-
nism with the help of cloud-based infrastructure in
smart grid. In this infrastructure, different equip-
ment are able to perform together efÔ¨Åciently.
3) Using cloud-based state estimation method [70] for
proactive and adaptive management for micro-grid.
Therefore, adequate strategy can be taken by service
providers in order to provide reliable energy services
to the end-users.
4) Cloud computing applications are expected to detect
intentional data leakage in smart grid. However,
data leakage may take place unintentionally as well.
Therefore, preventing unintentional data leakage is a
research challenge, while incorporating cloud com-
puting applications in the smart grid.
Privacy preserving data collection for different tasks
such as billing, and real-time monitoring.

6 OVERALL COMPARISON

We synthesize the studies presented in some of the existing
pieces of literature which address the issues related to smart
grid development, in the context of cloud-based, and non-
cloud-based (conventional) optimization mechanisms. The
different smart grid features‚Äîdemand side management,
micro-grid management,
load shifting, dynamic pricing,

cost-optimization, data storage, cyber-security, data secu-
rity, and threat detection‚Äîare discussed below.
a) Demand-side management. Allowing the customers to
take real-time decisions for modeling their energy con-
sumption is one of the key aspects of demand-side man-
agement. In the presence of a demand-side management
system, peak-hour load is reduced and shifted to the
non-peak hour. Logenthiran et al.
[73] presented a
demand-side management model based on a load shift-
ing mechanism using a heuristic-based evolutionary algo-
rithm (EA). Dynamic games model
is proposed for
distributed demand-side management in [74]. In such a
scenario, a two-layer architecture is considered‚Äîlower
layer (one household as one player), and upper layer (to
store the interaction mechanism among different players).
A sensor network is used as an emerging tool for smart
grid real-time monitoring systems [75]. The authors use
Sensor Web-services for demand-side energy manage-
ment for large-scale development of smart grid. Due to
the characteristics of huge storage and computation
mechanisms, cloud-based applications are proposed as
useful solutions for demand-side management efÔ¨Åciently,
as discussed in [31], [32], [33], [43], [44], [45].
b) Micro-grid management. A micro-grid is envisioned as
capable of distributing electricity to the end-users with
distributed generation facility, as discussed in Section 2.
The co-operative control strategy and energy manage-
ment is discussed in [81]. Jeon et al. [82] proposed a real-
time digital simulator-based test system for micro-grid
energy management. However, the autonomous activities
of micro-grids often lead to information islanding [6],
and as a consequence of which it is difÔ¨Åcult to exchange
the energy information with the other micro-grids [6].
These issues can be undertaken using cloud applications,
as discussed in [54], [55], [57], so that a micro-grid is able
to exchange energy information in the islanding mode
as well.
c) Load shifting. During peak hours, the load on the micro-
grids is more than that in the non-peak hours. Different load
shifting mechanisms are proposed in [73], [86], [106] for the
conventional smart grid environment
(without cloud).
Logenthiran et al. [73] proposed that the shift-able devices
such as washing machines, and refrigerator can be used in

1490

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 5, MAY 2015

the non-peak hours to relieve the load on the grid during
peak hours. A phase-based optimal service policy according
to periodically incoming jobs from end-users is proposed in
[86]. However, when there is an urgent requirement of
energy during the peak hours, then the customer is required
to pay high prices. This problem is addressed by the authors
in [31], [32], [41], [43], [44] with the implementation of cloud
energy services.
d) Cost-optimization. Due to the complex architecture of
smart grid, resource (energy and data) optimization mecha-
nisms is a challenging task. Several cost-optimization meth-
ods are proposed by the authors in [54], [55], [57], [93], [94].
Georgievski et al. [93] propose different cost-optimization
methods in the smart grid architecture. Georgievski et al.
[93] proposed a cost-optimization scheduling algorithm for
use in an ofÔ¨Åce environment and coupled it with the smart
grid architecture. However, automatic metering infrastruc-
ture (AMI), smart meters, and micro-grids technologies
make a complex architecture for large-scale development of
smart grid. Integrating these systems into cloud application
is useful, as discussed in Section 2.
e) Data storage. In Section 2, we discuss the need for
proper management of
incoming real-time information
from smart meters. Wang et al. [95] proposed a hierarchical
extended storage mechanism for massive dynamic data
(HES) storage and monitoring of data in different areas
according to different data types. An agent-based micro-
storage facility is studied by Vytelingum et al. [21]. How-
ever, these approaches are cost-prohibitive. The require-
ments of information processing from smart meters Ô¨Åt well
with the cloud applications [54]. In the absence of adopting
cloud applications in smart grid, the computing devices are
implemented within the end-users‚Äô energy management
devices. As an example, during the peak hours, utility
demands more computing and storage devices, and, thus,
information management and computation is a difÔ¨Åcult
task to handle within the internal computing devices, as it
has less memory and data storage capacity [67]. So, cloud
applications are addressed as an useful mechanism for
large-scale development of smart grid, as the authors sug-
gested in [53], [54], [55], [56], [57].
f) Dynamic pricing. Real-time pricing mechanisms are pro-
posed by the authors in [54], [55], [56], [57], [87], [88], [89],
[90], [91], [92]. Dynamic price is based on dynamic demand
from customers and total available power supply. However,
in the existing dynamic pricing method, dynamic-pricing
mechanism is modeled according to the load on the micro-
grids. For this reason, a proper pricing policy may not
always be maintained. So, using a cloud-based platform,
dynamic pricing can be modeled according to the load on
the cloud data center.
g) Cyber-security. Cyber-security is one of the important
considerations in a smart grid architecture [12]. Different
technologies are proposed to establish a secure smart grid
environment [12], [66], [67], [68], [98], [99]. McKinnon
et al. [98] proposed the digital-ants framework to identify
a cyber-attack in the smart grid. The cyber-security issues
are undertaken with the implementation of a human-
automation interaction (HAI) method in [99]. However,
cloud-based security technologies are useful
for cost-
effective mechanism, as cyber-security issues for a smart

grid can be handled using the existing cloud security
mechanisms [66], [67], [68].
h) Data security and privacy. In the smart grid architec-
ture, third-parties are allowed to participate in smart grid
energy and information management mechanisms. To
address customers‚Äô security and privacy issues, research-
ers proposed various security and privacy schemes to
motivate the customers [12], [67], [69], [70], [100], [101],
[102], [103], [107].
i) Theft and threat detection. In the traditional power grid
systems, no automatic methods exist for theft and threat
detection. In the smart grid environment, automatic theft
and threat detection mechanisms are proposed for reliable
power supply to the end-users [12], [65], [66], [67], [69], [70],
[100], [104], [105]. A distributed fault-tolerant, and theft
detection mechanism is proposed using linear system of
equations (LSE) in [100]. In such a mechanism, the status of
the customers is modeled as unity when they are honest.
On the other hand, when the status is greater than unity, the
customers are treated as dishonest, and, thus, theft detection
mechanism works to have secure smart grid architecture.
Some cloud-based security applications are proposed in
[67], [69], [70] for cost-effective security mechanisms in the
smart grid.

7 CONCLUSION

In this survey, we provided an overview of existing works
integrating cloud computing in the existing smart grid
architecture, in order to have reliable, efÔ¨Åcient and secure
energy distribution. Different aspects of smart grid‚Äîenergy
management, information management, and security‚Äîare dis-
cussed. We identiÔ¨Åed some important technical issues and
proposed several future research directions on cloud-based
smart grid.
From this surveyed work, we can see that the use of
cloud computing applications in smart grid is one of the
useful techniques to overcome issues related to tradi-
tional power grid management, despite the existence of
some technical challenges inherent of cloud computing
[108], [109].
In this paper, we provided several directions for future
research. We discussed the implementation of cloud energy
storage devices, and cloud data storage mechanisms for the
smart grid architecture. Using cloud computing applica-
tions, energy management techniques in smart grid can be
evaluated within the cloud, instead of between the end-
user‚Äôs devices. This architecture gives more memory and
storage to evaluate computing mechanism for energy man-
agement, and cost-optimization. On the issue of communi-
cation and information management in smart grid, cloud
computing is used in different scenarios. Cloud data-ward
can be used to process massive data from millions of smart
meters. Further, cloud computing even gives better security
capability than the conventional, pure IP-based security
mechanisms.
Thus, the integration of cloud computing in smart grid is
envisioned to be useful for evolving the smart grid architec-
ture further in terms of considerations such as monitoring
cost, computing, data management, power management,
and security.
