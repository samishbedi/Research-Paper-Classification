Abstract
The max-sum classiﬁer predicts n-tuple of labels from n-tuple of observable variables by maximiz-
ing a sum of quality functions deﬁned over neighbouring pairs of labels and observable variables.
Predicting labels as MAP assignments of a Random Markov Field is a particular example of the
max-sum classiﬁer . Learning parameters of the max-sum classiﬁer
is a challenging problem be-
cause even computing the response of such classiﬁer
is NP-complete in general. Estimating param-
eters using the Maximum Likelihood approach is feasible only for a subclass of max-sum classiﬁers
with an acyclic structure of neighbouring pairs. Recently, the discriminative methods represented
by the perceptron and the Support Vector Machines, originally designed for binary linear classiﬁers,
have been extended for learning some subclasses of the max-sum classiﬁer . Besides the max-sum
classiﬁers with the acyclic neighbouring structure, it has been shown that the discriminative learn-
ing is possible even with arbitrary neighbouring structure provided the quality functions ful ﬁll some
additional constraints. In this article, we extend the discriminative approach to other three classes
of max-sum classiﬁers with an arbitrary neighbourhood structure. We derive learning algorithms
for two subclasses of max-sum classiﬁers whose response can be computed in polynomial time: (i)
the max-sum classiﬁers with supermodular quality functions and (ii) the max-sum classiﬁers whose
response can be computed exactly by a linear programming relaxation. Moreover, we show that the
learning problem can be approximately solved even for a general max-sum classiﬁer .

1. Introduction
Let (T ; E ) be an undirected graph, where T is a ﬁnite set of objects and E (cid:18) (cid:0)T
2 (cid:1) is a set of object
pairs deﬁning a neighborhood structure. A pair ft ; t 0g of objects belonging to E will be called
neighbors or neighboring objects. Let each object t 2 T be characterized by an observation x t and
a label yt which take values from a ﬁnite set X and Y , respectively. We denote an ordered jT j-tuple
of observations by x = (xt 2 X j t 2 T ) and an ordered jT j-tuple of labels by y = (yt 2 Y j t 2 T ).
Each object t 2 T is assigned a function qt : Y (cid:2) X ! R which determines a quality of a label
yt given an observation xt . Each object pair ft ; t 0g 2 E is assigned a function gt t 0 : Y (cid:2) Y ! R

which determines the quality of labels yt and yt 0 . We adopt the convention gt t 0 (y; y0 ) = gt 0 t (y0 ; y).
Let q 2 RjT jjX jjY j and g 2 RjE jjY j2 be ordered tuples which contain elements qt (y; x), t 2 T , x 2 X ,
y 2 Y and gt t 0 (y; y0 ), ft ; t 0g 2 E , y; y0 2 Y , respectively. We consider a class of structured classiﬁer s
f : X T ! Y T parametrized by (q; g) that predict labeling y from observations x by selecting the
labeling with the maximal quality, that is,

We will call the classiﬁcation rule of the form (1) a max-sum classiﬁer . The problem of computing
the output of the max-sum classiﬁer , that is, the evaluation of the right-hand side of (1) is called
the max-sum labeling problem or shortly the max-sum problem (it is also known as the weighted
constraint satisfaction problem). The max-sum problem is known to be NP-complete in general.
We will use the six-tuple (T ; E ; Y ; q; g; x) to denote a max-sum problem instance which must be
solved to classify x.
This article deals with a problem of learning the parameters (q; g) of a max-sum classiﬁer
from a
ﬁnite training set L = (cid:8)(x j ; y j ) 2 X T (cid:2) Y T j j 2 f1; : : : ; mg(cid:9). Henceforth we will use the shortcut

random variables X = (Xt j t 2 T ) and Y = (Yt j t 2 T ). It is assumed that only the pairs of variables
(Xt ; Yt ), t 2 T and (Yt ; Yt 0 ), ft ; t 0g 2 E are directly statistically dependent. Then the joint probability
of X and Y is given by the Gibbs distribution

1.1 Existing Approaches to Learning Max-Sum Classiﬁers

is based on an estimation of parameters
A generative approach to learning a max-sum classiﬁer
(q; g) of the Gibbs distribution (2). Having the distribution estimated, a classiﬁer minimizing an
expected risk (Bayesian risk) for a given loss function can be inferred using the Bayesian decision
making framework. Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimation methods are well known for Markov
models with an acyclic graph (T ; E ) (see, for example, Schlesinger and Hlav ´a ˇc, 2002).
In the
general case, however, the ML estimation is not tractable because no polynomial time algorithm is
known for computing a partition function exactly. Approximate methods to compute the partition
function are based on a Gibbs sampler (Hinton and Sejnowski, 1986; Jerrum and Sinclair, 1993).
Another disadvantage of the generative approach is the fact that little is known about an expected
inferred from an imprecisely estimated statistical model.

A discriminative approach is an alternative method which does not require explicit modeling of
the underlying probability distribution. It is based on a direct optimization of classiﬁer parameters
(q; g) in order to minimize an error estimate of a classiﬁer performance computed on a ﬁnite train-
ing set. It is easy to see that the score function F (x; y; q; g) of the max-sum classiﬁer
(1) is linear
in its parameters (q; g) which allows to exploit methods for learning linear classiﬁers.
In the case
of a consistent training set, that is, if there exists a classiﬁer with zero empirical error, the problem
of learning a linear classiﬁer can be expressed as a problem of satisfying a set of linear inequali-
ties. This problem is efﬁciently solvable by the perceptron algorithm. Variants of the perceptron
algorithm for learning parameters of the max-sum classiﬁer
(1) with a chain and tree neighborhood
structure were published in Schlesinger and Hlav ´a ˇc (2002) and Collins (2002). These algorithms
exploit the fact that a perceptron can be used whenever the response of the learned classiﬁer can be
computed efﬁciently . This applies for the acyclic neighbourhood structure since the response of the
max-sum classiﬁer can be computed by the dynamic programming (DP).
The Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 1998) are another representative of a discrimi-
native approach for learning linear classiﬁers which has proved to be successful in numerous ap-
plications. Unlike the perceptron algorithm, the SVMs allows learning also from an inconsistent
training set. Learning is formulated as minimization of a regularized risk functional which can be
further transformed to a convex quadratic programming (QP) task suitable for optimization. The
original SVMs are designed for learning the classiﬁers which estimate a single label. In the recent
years, the SVMs have been extended for learning linear classiﬁers which can estimate a set of inter-
dependent labels. In particular, the Hidden Markov Support Vector Machines (Altun and Hofmann,
2003; Altun et al., 2003) and the Max-Margin Markov Networks (Taskar et al., 2004b) were pro-
posed for learning max-sum classiﬁers with an acyclic neighboring structure. In this case, learning
requires solving a QP task with a huge number of linear constraints proportional to the cardinality
of the output space of the classiﬁer . In analogy to the perceptron, this task is tractable if there ex-
ists an efﬁcient algorithm that solves the loss-augmented classiﬁcation (LAC) task which involves
optimizing (1) with the loss function added to the objective function F (x; y; q; g) (c.f. Section 3.2
for details). For additively decomposable loss functions, the LAC task becomes an instance of the
max-sum problem easily solvable by the DP provided the neighbourhood structure is acyclic.
Learning of the Associative Markov Networks (AMN) with an arbitrary neighbourhood struc-
ture E was proposed by Taskar et al. (2004a). The AMN is the max-sum classiﬁer with the quality
functions g restricted in a way similar to the Potts model. The LAC task was approximated by a
linear programming (LP) relaxation specially derived for the AMN model. Incorporating an LP re-
laxation into the SVM QP task, Taskar et al. (2004a) constructed a new compact QP task which has
only a polynomial number of constraints. Even though the resulting QP task is polynomially solv-
able, general purpose QP solvers do not provide a practical solution since they scale poorly with
the problem and training set size. Recently, Taskar et al. (2006) proposed a reformulation of the
structured learning problem as a convex-concave saddle-point problem which is efﬁciently solvable
by the dual extragradient algorithm. This new framework is applicable for structured classiﬁers
for
which a certain projection step can be solved. Taskar et al. (2006) showed that the projection step
is tractable for the max-sum classiﬁers with supermodular functions g and binary labels jY j = 2.
Tsochantaridis et al. (2005) proposed a general framework for learning linear classiﬁers with an
interdependent labels. Their approach is based on solving the underlying SVM QP task by a cutting
plane algorithm which requires as a subroutine an algorithm solving the LAC task for the particular
since the
classiﬁer . The approach cannot be directly applied for the general max-sum classiﬁers

LAC task is not tractable. An alternative approach to the cutting plane algorithm was proposed by
Ratliff and Bagnell (2006) who used subgradient methods for optimizing the SVM QP task. This
approach also relies on an efﬁcient
solution to the LAC task.
An approximated cutting plane algorithm was proposed in Finley and Joachims (2005) to learn
a speciﬁc structured model for correlation clustering. The inference as well as the corresponding
LAC task of this clustering model are NP-complete. The authors suggested to replace an exact
solution of the LAC task required in the cutting plane algorithm by its polynomially solvable LP
relaxation.

1.2 Contributions

In this article, we build on the previously published approaches which use the perceptron and the
SVMs for learning the max-sum classiﬁers. We propose learning algorithms for three classes of
max-sum classiﬁers
for which, up to our knowledge, the discriminative approaches have not been
applied yet. Namely, the contributions of the article are as follows:

(cid:15) We formulate and solve the problem of learning the supermodular max-sum classiﬁer with
an arbitrary neighbourhood structure E and without any restriction on the number of labels
jY j (Taskar et al., 2006, consider only two labels). We propose a variant of the perceptron
algorithm for learning from a consistent training set. For an inconsistent training set, we
extend the cutting plane algorithm of Tsochantaridis et al. (2005) such that it maintains the
quality functions g supermodular during the course of the algorithm thus making the LAC
task efﬁciently solvable.

(cid:15) We formulate and solve the problem of learning the max-sum classiﬁer with a strictly trivial
equivalent which is a subclass of max-sum classiﬁer s with a trivial equivalent. We will show
in Section 2 that the latter class can be equivalently characterized by the fact that the LP
relaxation (Schlesinger, 1976; Koster et al., 1998; Chekuri et al., 2001; Wainwright et al.,
2002) is tight for it. It is known, that the class of problems with a trivial equivalent contains
acyclic problems (Schlesinger, 1976) and supermodular problems (Schlesinger and Flach,
2000). We will extend this result to show that problems with a strictly trivial equivalent which
we can learn contain the acyclic and the supermodular max-sum problems with a unique
solution.

Learning of the max-sum classiﬁers with a strictly trivial equivalent leads to an optimization
problem with a polynomial number of linear constraints. We propose variants of the per-
ceptron and of the cutting plane algorithm for learning from a consistent and an inconsistent
training set, respectively. In this case, the LAC task does not require any specialized max-sum
solver since it can be solved exhaustively. Moreover, the QP task to which we transform the
learning problem is of the same form as the QP task required for ordinary multi-class SVMs
(Crammer and Singer, 2001) which allows using existing optimization packages.

(cid:15) We formulate the problem of learning the general max-sum classiﬁer , that is, without any
restriction on the neighborhood structure E and the quality functions g. We show that the
learning problem can be solved approximately by a variant of the cutting plane algorithm
proposed by Finley and Joachims (2005) which uses the LP relaxation to solve the LAC task
approximately. In contrast to Taskar et al. (2004a), we do not incorporate the LP relaxation

70

D I SCR IM INAT IV E L EARN ING O F MAX -SUM C LA S S I FIER S

to the SVM QP task but we keep it separately which allows to exploit existing solvers for LP
relaxation of the max-sum problem.

For a simplicity, we will concentrate on the max-sum classiﬁer
(1). All the proposed methods,
however, are applicable whenever the set of labels Y is ﬁnite and the quality functions are linear in
parameters, that is, they are of the form qt (xt ; yt ) = hw; Yt (xt ; yt )i and gt t 0 (yt ; yt ) = hw; Yt t 0 (yt ; yt 0 )i
where w 2 Rd is a parameter vector and Yt : X (cid:2) Y ! Rd , Yt t 0 : Y (cid:2) Y ! Rd are arbitrary ﬁx ed
mappings. Furthermore, all the proposed algorithms can be introduced in the form containing
only dot products between Yt (x; y) and Yt t 0 (y; y0 ) which allows to use the kernel functions (Vap-
nik, 1998).

1.3 Structure of the Article

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe three classes of the max-sum classiﬁers
for which we will later derive learning algorithms. Perceptron algorithm and the SVM framework
for learning linear classiﬁers with an interdependent labels is reviewed in Section 3. In Section 4,
we formulate problems of learning the max-sum classiﬁers
from a consistent training set and we
propose variants of the perceptron algorithm for their solution. In Section 5, we formulate problems
of learning the max-sum classiﬁers
from inconsistent training set using the SVM framework. In
Section 6, we propose an extended cutting plane algorithm to solve the learning problem deﬁned in
Section 5. Section 7 describes experiments. Finally, in Section 8 we give conclusions.

2. Classes of Max-Sum Problems
In the rest of the article, we consider the max-sum problems P = (T ; E ; Y ; q; g; x) in which (T ; E )
is an arbitrary undirected connected graph and q are arbitrary quality functions. The three classes
of the max-sum problems described below differ in the structure of the ﬁnite set of labels Y and the
quality functions g.

2.1 General Max-Sum Problem and LP Relaxation

The ﬁrst class which we consider is the general max-sum problem with no restrictions imposed on
Y and g. Solving (1) when P is a general max-sum problem is known to be NP-complete. An ap-
proximate solution can be found by the linear programming (LP) relaxation proposed independently
by Schlesinger (1976), Koster et al. (1998), Chekuri et al. (2001), and Wainwright et al. (2002). We
introduce only the basic concepts of the LP relaxation necessary for this article. For more details
on the topic we refer to the mentioned publications or to a comprehensive survey in Werner (2007)
from which we adopted notation and terminology.
Let (T (cid:2) Y ; EY ) denote an undirected graph with edges EY = ff(t ; y); (t 0 ; y0 )g j ft ; t 0g 2 E ; y; y0 2
Y g. This graph corresponds to the trellis diagram used to visualize Markov chains. Each node
(t ; y) 2 T (cid:2) Y and each edge f(t ; y); (t 0 ; y0 )g 2 EY is assigned the numbers bt (y) and bt t 0 (y; y0 ), re-
spectively. Let bbb 2 RjT jjY j+jE jjY j2 be an ordered tuple which contains elements bt (y), (t ; y) 2 T (cid:2) Y
and bt t 0 (y; y0 ), f(t ; y); (t 0 ; y0 )g 2 EY . Let LP denote a set of relaxed labelings which contains vectors
bbb satisfying
(cid:229)

bt t 0 (y; y0 ) = bt (y) ; ft ; t 0g 2 E ; y 2 Y ;

(cid:229)
y2Y

bt (y) = 1 ; t 2 T ;

bbb (cid:21) 0 :

FRANC AND SAVCHYN SKYY

The LP relaxation of (1) reads
bbb2LP (cid:20) (cid:229)
(cid:229)
bt (y)qt (y; xt ) + (cid:229)
(cid:229)
bt t 0 (y; y0 )gt t 0 (y; y0 )(cid:21) :
bbb(cid:3) = argmax
y2Y
t 2T
(t ;t 0 )2E
(y;y0 )2Y 2
It can be seen that solving (3) with an additional constraint bbb 2 f0; 1gT is an integer programming
problem equivalent to (1). Further, we will introduce concepts of equivalent problems, equivalent
transformations and trivial problems which are tightly connected to the LP relaxation.
A representation of the max-sum problem P = (T ; E ; Y ; q; g; x) is not minimal since there exists
an inﬁnite number of equivalent max-sum problems P 0 = (T ; E ; Y ; q0 ; g0 ; x) with different quality
functions (q0 , g0 ) but the same quality for all labelings: the max-sum problems P and P 0 are called
equivalent if F (x; y; q; g) = F (x; y; q0 ; g0 ) for all y 2 Y T (Schlesinger, 1976; Wainwright et al.,
2002).
Next, we introduce a transformation of a max-sum problem to its arbitrary equivalent. These
equivalent transformations are originally due to Schlesinger (1976) and recently are also known
as reparametrization in Wainwright et al. (2002) and Kolmogorov (2006). Let j t t 0 : Y ! R and
jt 0 t : Y ! R be a pair of functions introduced for each pair of neighbouring objects ft ; t 0g 2 E , that
is, we have 2jE j functions in total. The value jt t 0 (y) is called potential at label y of an object t in the
direction t 0 . Note that the potentials correspond to messages in belief propagation (see, for example,
Pearl, 1988; Yedidia et al., 2005). We will use jjj 2 R2jE jjY j to denote an ordered tuple which contains
elements jt t 0 (y), ft ; t 0g 2 E , y 2 Y and jt 0 t (y0 ), ft ; t 0g 2 E , y0 2 Y . Let N (t ) = ft 0 2 T j ft ; t 0g 2 E g
denote the set of objects neighbouring with the object t 2 T . Finally, let Pjjj
= (T ; E ; Y ; qjjj
; gjjj
; x)
denote the max-sum problem constructed from the max-sum problem P = (T ; E ; Y ; q; g; x) by the
following transformation
jjj
t t 0 (y; y0 ) = gt t 0 (y; y0 ) + jt t 0 (y) + jt 0 t (y0 ) ;
g
t (y; xt ) = qt (y; xt ) (cid:0) (cid:229)
jjj
jt t 0 (y) ;
q
t 02N (t )
By substituting (4) to F (x; y; q; g) = F (x; y; q0 ; g0 ) it is easy to show that the problems P and Pjjj are
equivalent for arbitrary potentials jjj. Moreover, it has been shown (Schlesinger, 1976; Kolmogorov,
2006) that the converse is also true, that is, if any two max-sum problems are equivalent then they
are related by (4) for some potentials jjj.
Now, we can deﬁne
the class of trivial max-sum problems. Node (t ; y) is called maximal if
qt (y; xt ) = maxy2Y qt (y; xt ) and edge f(t ; y); (t 0 ; y0 )g is called maximal if gt t 0 (y; y0 ) = maxy;y02Y gt t 0 (y; y0 ).
The max-sum problem P is called trivial if there exists a labeling y which can be formed only from
the maximal nodes and edges. Checking whether a given P is trivial leads to an instance of a con-
straint satisfaction problem CSP (also called consistent labeling problem) (Rosenfeld et al., 1976;
Haralick and Shapiro, 1979). The CSP is NP-complete in general and it is equivalent to solving a
max-sum problem when the quality functions (q; g) take only two values f(cid:0)¥; 0g. Let U (x; q; g) be
a height (also called energy) of the max-sum problem P deﬁned as a sum of qualities of the maximal
nodes and the maximal edges, that is,
U (x; q; g) = (cid:229)
qt (y; xt ) + (cid:229)
t 2T
ft ;t 0 g2E
Comparing (1) and (5) shows that U (x; q; g) is an upper bound on the quality of the optimal labeling,
that is, U (x; q; g) (cid:21) maxy2Y T F (x; y; q; g). It is easy to see that the upper bound is tight if and only
if the max-sum problem is trivial. The following result is central to the LP relaxation:

Theorem 1 Schlesinger (1976); Werner (2005) Let C be a class of equivalent max-sum problems.
Let C contain at least one trivial problem. Then any problem in C is trivial if and only if it has
minimal height.
This suggests to solve the max-sum problem P by searching for an equivalent Pjjj with the minimal
height, which leads to

U (x; qjjj

; gjjj

jjj(cid:3) = argmin

) :

(6)

The problem (6) can be expressed as an LP task which is known to be a dual to the LP relaxation (3).
Having jjj(cid:3) one can try to verify whether Pjjj(cid:3) is trivial, that is, whether there exists a labeling com-
posed of the maximal nodes and edges of Pjjj(cid:3) . If such labeling is found then it is the optimal solution
of the max-sum problem P. Otherwise, one can use heuristics to ﬁnd an approximate solution by
searching for such labeling which contains as much maximal nodes and edges as possible.
Though (6) is solvable in polynomial time, a general purpose LP solvers are applicable only for
small instances. A specialized solvers for LP relaxation were published in Koval and Schlesinger
(1976). Recently, Wainwright et al. (2002) and Kolmogorov (2006) proposed a tree-reweighted
algorithm based on minimizing a more general upper bound composed of trees spanning the graph
(T ; E ) of which (5) is a special case.
We propose a learning algorithm for a general max-sum classiﬁer which requires an arbitrary
LP relaxation solver as a subroutine. We only require that the LP solver returns an approximate
solution ˆy and an upper bound on maxy2Y T F (x; y; q; g).

2.2 Supermodular Max-Sum Problems
Deﬁnition 1 A function gt t 0 : Y (cid:2) Y ! R is supermodular if

t and yt 0 > y0

2. For each four-tuple (yt ; y0
t 0 the following
inequality holds:

t ; y0
gt t 0 (yt ; yt 0 ) + gt t 0 (y0
t 0 ) (cid:21) gt t 0 (yt ; y0
t 0 ) + gt t 0 (y0
t ; yt 0 ):

(7)

A max-sum problem in which the label set Y is totally ordered and all the functions g are supermod-
ular is called a supermodular max-sum problem. In addition, we will also consider the max-sum
problem in which the inequalities (7) are fulﬁlled strictly. In this case the corresponding max-sum
problem will be called strictly supermodular.
A naive approach to check whether a given max-sum problem is supermodular amounts to
verifying all jE j (cid:1) jY j4 inequalities in (7). We will use a more effective way which requires to check
only jE j (cid:1) (jY j (cid:0) 1)2 inequalities thanks to the following well-known theorem:

Theorem 2 The function gt t 0 : Y (cid:2) Y ! R is supermodular if for each each pair of labels (y; y 0 ) 2 Y 2
such that y + 1 2 Y ; y0 + 1 2 Y the following inequality holds

gt t 0 (y; y0 ) + gt t 0 (y + 1; y0 + 1) (cid:21) gt t 0 (y; y0 + 1) + gt t 0 (y + 1; y0 ):

Proof The proof follows trivially from the equality

t ; y0
gt t 0 (yt ; yt 0 ) + gt t 0 (y0
t 0 ) (cid:0) gt t 0 (yt ; y0
t 0 ) (cid:0) gt t 0 (y0
t ; yt 0 )
= (cid:229)
(cid:20)gt t 0 (z; z0 ) + gt t 0 (z + 1; z0 + 1) (cid:0) gt t 0 (z; z0 + 1) (cid:0) gt t 0 (z + 1; z0 )(cid:21) ;
yt >z(cid:21)y0
t
yt 0 >z0(cid:21)y0
t 0

and the fact that all the summands are non-negative by the condition (8).

A similar proposition holds for strictly supermodular problems: a max-sum problem is strictly
supermodular if for each pair of neighboring objects ft ; t 0g 2 E and for each pair of labels (y; y0 ) 2 Y 2
such that y + 1 2 Y ; y0 + 1 2 Y the following inequality holds:

gt t 0 (y; y0 ) + gt t 0 (y + 1; y0 + 1) > gt t 0 (y; y0 + 1) + gt t 0 (y + 1; y0 ):

(9)

In this paper, we exploit the fact that the optimal solution of the supermodular problems can be
found in a polynomial time (Schlesinger and Flach, 2000). Kolmogorov and Zabih (2002) proposed
an efﬁcient algorithm for the binary case jY j = 2 which is based on transforming the supermodular
max-sum problem to the max- ﬂo w problem from the graph theory. A not widely known extension
for a general case jY j > 2 was proposed in Kovtun (2004) and Schlesinger (2005). We will propose
learning algorithms which require an arbitrary solver for the supermodular max-sum problem as a
subroutine.

2.3 Max-Sum Problems with Strictly Trivial Equivalent

In this section we consider max-sum problems with a strictly trivial equivalent which is a subclass
of problems with a trivial equivalent described in Section (2.1). The main reason for deﬁning this
subclass is that these problems are more suitable for learning than problems with a trivial equiv-
alent. It was shown (Schlesinger, 1976; Schlesinger and Flach, 2000) that problems with a trivial
equivalent contain two well-known polynomially solvable subclasses of max-sum problems: (i) the
problems with an acyclic neighborhood structure E and (ii) the supermodular problems. We will
give a similar result which applies for the problems with a strictly trivial equivalent. In particu-
lar, we will show that the class of problems with a strictly trivial equivalent contains all acyclic
and supermodular problems which have a unique solution. This shows that learning algorithms for
the max-sum classiﬁers with a strictly trivial equivalent introduced below are applicable for a wide
range of polynomially solvable problems.
Max-sum problems with a trivial equivalent are those for which LP relaxation (6) is tight,
; gjjj(cid:3)
that is, U (x; qjjj(cid:3)
) = maxy2Y T F (x; y; q; g), and thus maxy2Y T F (x; y; q; g) can be computed in
a polynomial time. The tight LP relaxation, however, does not imply that the optimal solution
y(cid:3) = argmaxy2Y T F (x; y; q; g) can be found in a polynomial time. As we mentioned, to ﬁnd y (cid:3) from
(qjjj(cid:3)
; gjjj(cid:3)
) requires searching for a labeling formed only by the maximal nodes and edges which need
not be unique. Finding such labeling leads to the CSP which is NP-complete. We exploit the fact
that the labeling can be found trivially if all the maximal nodes and edges are unique. As a result,
the optimal solution y(cid:3) can be found in a polynomial time by solving the LP relaxation and ﬁnding
the maximal nodes and edges.

Deﬁnition 2 Max-sum problem P is strictly trivial if:
1. There exists a unique maximal node (t ; y) for each object t 2 T .
2. For each maximal edge f(t ; y); (t 0 ; y0 )g 2 EY the nodes (t ; y) and (t 0 ; y0 ) are maximal.

It is clear that a strictly trivial problem has a unique solution which is composed of all maximal
nodes and edges. Checking whether a given problem is strictly trivial requires only O (jT jjY j +
jE jjY j2 ) operations, that is, ﬁnding the maximal nodes and edges and checking if they are unique
and if they form a labeling.
Recall that the max-sum problem P has a strictly trivial equivalent if there exists a strictly trivial
problem which is equivalent to P. Finally, we give a theorem which asserts that the class of prob-
lems with a strictly trivial equivalent includes at least the acyclic problems and the supermodular
problems which have a unique solution.

Theorem 3 Let P = (T ; E ; Y ; q; g; x) be a max-sum problem and let P have a unique solution. If
(T ; E ) is an acyclic graph or quality functions g are supermodular then P is equivalent to some
strictly trivial problem.

Proof is given in Appendix A.

3. Discriminative Approach to Learning Structured Linear Classiﬁers

In this section, we review the discriminative approach to learning linear classiﬁers which we will
later apply to the max-sum classiﬁers.
Let x 2 XXX and y 2 YYY be observations and labels generated according to some ﬁx ed unknown
f : XXX ! YYY which estimates labels
distribution P(x; y). We are interested in designing a classiﬁer
from observations. Let L : YYY (cid:2) YYY ! R be a loss function penalizing a prediction f (x) by a penalty
L(y; f (x)) provided the true output is y. The goal is to ﬁnd a classiﬁer which minimizes the expected
(Bayesian) risk

L(y; f (x)) dP(x; y) :

R[ f ] = ZXXX (cid:2)YYY
The risk R[ f ] cannot be directly minimized because the distribution P(x; y) is unknown. Instead, we
are given a ﬁnite training set L = f(x j ; y j ) 2 XXX (cid:2) YYY j j 2 J g i.i.d. sampled from P(x; y).
The discriminative approach to learning classiﬁers does not require estimation of a probability
distribution. It is based on direct optimization of parameters of a classiﬁer
in order to minimize a
substitutional risk functional which approximates the desired risk R[ f ] and can be computed from a
ﬁnite training set. Let us consider a class of linear classiﬁers

f (x; w) = argmax

Let us assume a class of loss functions which satisfy L(y; y 0 ) = 0 if y = y0 and L(y; y0 ) > 0 if y 6= y0 .
Further, we will distinguish two learning scenarios: (i) learning from a consistent training set and (ii)
learning from an inconsistent training set. The training set L is consistent if there exists a parameter
vector w(cid:3) such that the empirical risk of the linear classiﬁer
is zero, that is, Remp [ f ((cid:15); w(cid:3) )] = 0. In
the opposite case, the training set is inconsistent.
from a
In Section 3.1, we review the perceptron algorithm suitable for learning linear classiﬁers
consistent training set. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach to learning from an inconsis-
tent training set is described in Section 3.2.

3.1 Learning from a Consistent Training Set Using the Perceptron Algorithm
In the case of a consistent training set L , the learning problem is to ﬁnd parameters w (cid:3) of the linear
(10) such that the empirical risk Remp [ f ((cid:15); w(cid:3) )] = 0. This amounts to ﬁnding parameters
classiﬁer
w(cid:3) which satisfy the set of non-linear equations

j 2 J :

(11)

In the rest of the article, we will assume that the training set does not contain examples with the same
observations x j = x j 0 but different labelings y j 6= y j 0 , that is, we will search for a classiﬁer which
returns a unique labeling for each example from the training set. It is convenient to transform (11)
to an equivalent problem of solving a set of linear strict inequalities

hw; Y(x j ; y j )i > hw; Y(x j ; y)i ;
j 2 J ; y 2 YYY n fy j g ;
which, using ˆY(x j ; y j ; y) = Y(x j ; y j ) (cid:0) Y(x j ; y), can be written in a compact form
hw; ˆY(x j ; y j ; y)i > 0 ;

j 2 J ; y 2 YYY n fy j g :

An efﬁcient method to solve the problem (12) is the perceptron algorithm:

(12)

Algorithm 1 Perceptron algorithm
1: Set w := 0.

2: Find a violated inequality in (12), that is, ﬁnd indices j (cid:3) 2 J , y(cid:3) 2 YYY n fy j(cid:3)

3: If there is no violated inequality then w solves (12) and the algorithm halts. Otherwise update
the current solution
w := w + ˆY(x j(cid:3)
; y j(cid:3)

; y(cid:3) ) ;

and go to Step 2.

Provided the training set L is consistent, that is, the inequalities (12) are satisﬁable,
the percep-
tron terminates after a ﬁnite number of iterations (Novikoff, 1962). The number of iterations of the
perceptron algorithm does not depend on the number of inequalities of (12). This property is crucial
for the problems with a very large number of inequalities, which are of interest in our article.

76

D I SCR IM INAT IV E L EARN ING O F MAX -SUM C LA S S I FIER S

In Step 2, the perceptron algorithm needs to ﬁnd a violated inequality in (12). This subtask can
responses ˆy j = f (x j ; w), j 2 J by evaluating (10). If for some
be solved by computing the classiﬁer
j 2 J the response ˆy j 6= y j , that is, the classiﬁer commits an error on the j-th example, then the
indices ( j; ˆy j ) identify the violated inequality. As a result, the perceptron algorithm is applicable
for learning of an arbitrary linear classiﬁer
for which the classiﬁcation task (10) can be evaluated
efﬁciently .
In case of a general max-sum classiﬁer , the classiﬁcation task is NP-complete so that using the
perceptron algorithm is not feasible. In Section 4 we will show, however, how to use the perceptron
for learning the strictly supermodular max-sum classiﬁers and the max-sum classiﬁers with a strictly
trivial equivalent.

3.2 Learning from Inconsistent Training Set Using SVM Approach

In practical applications, the training set is often inconsistent. SVMs (Vapnik, 1998) constitute a
popular approach to learning linear classiﬁers applicable to both consistent and inconsistent training
sets. The SVM learning is based on minimizing regularized risk which is a sum of the empirical risk
Remp [ f ((cid:15); w)] and a regularization term. Minimization of the regularization term corresponds to the
notion of large margin introduced to prevent over-ﬁtting. Since the empirical risk is not convex for
most loss functions used in classiﬁcation it is replaced by a convex piece-wise linear upper bound
which is more suitable for optimization. Originally, SVMs were designed for a binary case jYYY j = 2
and 0=1-loss function L0=1 (y; y0 ) = [[y 6= y0 ]] where [[(cid:15)]] equals 1 if the term inside the brackets
is satisﬁed and it is 0 otherwise. The multi-class variant of SVMs (jYYY j > 2) were introduced in
Vapnik (1998) and Crammer and Singer (2001) but it still assumes the 0=1-loss only function.
Taskar et al. (2004b) extended SVMs for learning the max-sum classiﬁers
(1) with an acyclic
neighbourhood structure and they proposed using the additive loss function (14) suitable for these
problems. Recently, the approach was generalized by Tsochantaridis et al. (2005) who consider an
arbitrary structured linear classiﬁer
(10) and a general loss function. Learning of structured SVMs
leads to the following convex QP task

The objective function of (13) comprises the regularization term 1

weighted by the regularization constant C > 0. It can be shown (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005) that
(cid:229) j2J x j is an upper bound on the empirical risk Remp [ f ((cid:15); w)] of the linear classiﬁer
the sum 1
(10).
m
Thus the learning objective is to minimize an upper bound on the empirical risk and to penalize
parameters with high kwk2 . The loss function can be an arbitrary function L : YYY (cid:2) YYY ! R which
satisﬁes L(y; y0 ) = 0 if y = y0 and ¥ > L(y; y0 ) > 0 if y 6= y0 . In cases which are of interest in our
article, the set YYY = Y T and a reasonable choice is the additive loss function, also known as the
Hamming distance, which is deﬁned as
LD (y; y0 ) = (cid:229)
t 2T

[[yt 6= y0
t ]] ;

(14)

77

FRANC AND SAVCHYN SKYY

that is, it counts the number of misclassiﬁed objects. The trade-off between the regularization term
and the upper bound is controlled by the constant C. A suitable setting is usually found by tuning C
on an independent data set or using the cross-validation.
The number of constraints (13b) equals to mjYYY j. In the structured learning jYYY j is huge, for
it grows exponentially because jYYY j = jY jjT j . As
example, in the case of the max-sum classiﬁers
a result, the QP task (13) is not tractable for general purpose QP solvers. Tsochantaridis et al.
(2005) proposed a specialized cutting plane algorithm to approximate (13) by a reduced QP task
which has the same objective function (13a) but uses only a small subset of the constraints (13b).
The efﬁcienc y of the approximation relies on the sparseness of the solution (13) which means that
majority of the linear inequality constraints (13b) are inactive and they can be excluded without
affecting the solution. To select the constraints, the cutting plane algorithm requires solving the
LAC task
y2YYY (cid:20)L(y j ; y) + (cid:10)w; Y(x j ; y)(cid:11)(cid:21) :
y(cid:3) = argmax
Similarly to the perceptron algorithm, the cutting plane algorithm is applicable for learning of an
arbitrary linear classiﬁer
for which the LAC task (15) can be solved efﬁciently .
In case of a general max-sum classiﬁer and an additive loss function the LAC task becomes an
instance of a general max-sum problem. Even though a general max-sum problem can be solved
only approximately, we will show that it sufﬁces
to solve the learning problem (13) with a good
precision. Moreover, we will be able to determine how the found solution differs from the optimal
one. In case of a supermodular max-sum classiﬁer we will augment the learning problem (13) in
such a way that the obtained quality functions will be supermodular and thus the task (15) becomes
solvable precisely in a polynomial time. Finally, in case of a max-sum problem with a strictly trivial
equivalent, we will give a new formulation of the learning problem which does not require solving
the task (15) at all since the number of constraints will be sufﬁciently small to use an exhaustive
search.

(15)

4. Learning a Max-Sum Classi ﬁer from a Consistent Training Set

In this section, we assume that the training set is consistent with respect to a given max-sum classi-
ﬁer . This means that there exists at least one max-sum classiﬁer
in a given class which classiﬁes all
training examples correctly. We will introduce variants of the perceptron algorithm which, provided
the assumption holds, ﬁnd a classiﬁer
in a ﬁnite number of iterations. In practice, however, there is
no general way to verify whether the assumption holds unless the perceptron halts. Consequently, if
the perceptron algorithm does not halt after a reasonable number of iterations we cannot draw any
conclusion about the solution. In Section 5, we will avoid this drawback using the SVM approach
able to deal with inconsistent training sets.
To use the perceptron algorithm, we will reformulate the learning problem as an equivalent
task of satisfying a set of linear strict inequalities. A keystone of the perceptron algorithm is an
efﬁcient procedure to ﬁnd a violated inequality in the underlying set which amounts to classifying
the examples from the training set. Therefore, using the perceptron algorithm is not feasible for the
general max-sum problem whose evaluation is NP-complete. Nevertheless, we will formulate the
learning problem even for this case because it will serve as a basis for constructing the algorithm for
an inconsistent training set. Next, we will derive learning algorithms for strictly supermodular max-
sum classiﬁers and max-sum classiﬁers with a strictly trivial equivalent. For these two classes, max-

78

D I SCR IM INAT IV E L EARN ING O F MAX -SUM C LA S S I FIER S

sum classi ﬁers can be evaluated efﬁciently by polynomial-time algorithms which makes possible to
use the perceptron. Moreover, in the case of a max-sum classiﬁer with a strictly trivial equivalent,
learning will require ﬁnding a violated inequality from only a polynomially-sized set which can be
accomplished exhaustively without any max-sum solver.

4.1 General Max-Sum Classi ﬁer

Problem 1 (Learning a general max-sum classiﬁer
from a consistent training set). For a given
training set L = f(x j ; y j ) 2 X T (cid:2) Y T j j 2 J g ﬁnd quality functions q and g such that

y j = argmax
y2Y T

F (x j ; y; q; g);

j 2 J :

(16)

It can be seen, that the general max-sum classiﬁer
(1) can be represented as the linear clas-
In particular, the quality functions q and g are merged to a single parameter vector
siﬁer
(10).
w = (q; g) 2 Rd of dimension d = jT jjY jjX j + jE jjY j2 . Further, we have XXX = X T and YYY = Y T .
The mapping Y : X T (cid:2) Y T ! Rd can be constructed of indicator functions in such a way that
F (x; y; q; g) = hw; Y(x; y)i.
Following the approach of learning linear classiﬁers described in Section 3.1, we can reformu-
late Problem 1 to an equivalent problem of solving a huge set of linear inequalities

F (x j ; y j ; q; g) > F (x j ; y; q; g) ;

j 2 J ; y 2 Y T nfy j g :

(17)

To ﬁnd a solution of (17) by the perceptron, we would need an efﬁcient algorithm to compute
a response of a general max-sum classiﬁer . Because solving a max-sum problem is NP-complete
in general, using the perceptron algorithm is not tractable. In Section 5.1, we will use the formu-
lation (17) as a basis for constructing an algorithm for learning from an inconsistent training set.
In this case, it will be possible to use the LP relaxation to approximate the response of a max-sum
classiﬁer .

4.2 Strictly Supermodular Max-Sum Classiﬁer

Problem 2 (Learning strictly supermodular max-sum classiﬁer from a consistent training set). For
a given training set L = f(x j ; y j ) 2 X T (cid:2) Y T j j 2 J g ﬁnd quality functions q and g such that
equations (16) are satisﬁed and the quality functions g are strictly supermodular, that is, g satisfy
the condition (9).

Similarly to the general case, we reformulate Problem 2 as an equivalent problem of solving a
set of strict linear inequalities

j 2 J ; y 2 Y T nfy j g ;
F (x j ; y j ; q; g) > F (x j ; y; q; g) ;
: )
gt t 0 (cid:0)y; y0(cid:1) + gt t 0 (cid:0)y + 1; y0 + 1(cid:1) > gt t 0 (cid:0)y; y0 + 1(cid:1) + gt t 0 (cid:0)y + 1; y0(cid:1) ;
ft ; t 0g 2 E ; (y; y0 ) 2 (cid:8)1; : : : ; jY j (cid:0) 1(cid:9)2
The system (18) comprises two sets of linear inequalities (18a) and (18b). The inequali-
ties (18a) enforce an error-less response of a max-sum classiﬁer on the training set. The inequal-
ities (18b), if satisﬁed, guarantee that the quality functions g are strictly supermodular (c.f. Sec-
tion 2.2).

(18b)

(18a)

79

FRANC AND SAVCHYN SKYY

To apply the perceptron algorithm we need an efﬁcient method to ﬁnd a violated inequality
in (18). In the case of the inequalities (18b), it can be accomplished by an exhaustive search since
there are only jE j(jY j (cid:0) 1)2 inequalities. To ﬁnd a violated inequality in (18a), where the number
m(jY jjT j (cid:0) 1) grows exponentially, we need to compute the response of a max-sum classiﬁer on
the training examples. This can be done efﬁciently provided the inequalities (18b) are already
satisﬁed as it guarantees that the qualities g are supermodular. Thus we use the perceptron algorithm
to repeatedly solve the inequalities (18b) and, as soon as (18b) are satisﬁed, we ﬁnd a violated
inequality in (18a) by solving a supermodular max-sum problem. The proposed variant of the
perceptron to solve (18) is as follows:

Algorithm 2 Learning strictly supermodular max-sum classiﬁer by perceptron

1: Set q := 0 and g := 0.

2: Find a violated inequality in (18b), that is, ﬁnd a quadruple ft ; t 0g 2 E ; y; y0 2 Y such that

gt t 0 (y; y0 ) + gt t 0 (y + 1; y0 + 1) (cid:0) gt t 0 (y; y0 + 1) (cid:0) gt t 0 (y + 1; y0 ) (cid:20) 0 :

3: If no such quadruple (t ; t 0 ; y; y0 ) exists then (g are already supermodular) go to Step 4. Otherwise
use the found (t ; t 0 ; y; y0 ) to update current g by

gt t 0 (y; y0 )
gt t 0 (y; y0 + 1)

gt t 0 (y; y0 ) + 1 ; gt t 0 (y + 1; y0 + 1)
:=
gt t 0 (y + 1; y0 )
:= gt t 0 (y; y0 + 1) (cid:0) 1 ;

:= gt t 0 (y + 1; y0 + 1) + 1 ;
gt t 0 (y + 1; y0 ) (cid:0) 1 ;
:=

and go to Step 2.

4: Find a violated inequality in (18a), that is, ﬁnd an index j 2 J and a labeling y such that

y j 6= y := argmax
y02Y T

F (x j ; y0 ; q; g) :

5: If no such ( j, y) exist than (q; g) solve the task (18) and the algorithm halts. Otherwise use the
found ( j, y) to update current q and g by

gt t 0 (y j
t ; y j
t 0 )
t ; x j
qt (y j
t )

:= gt t 0 (y j
t ; y j
t 0 ) + 1; gt t 0 (yt ; yt 0 )

:= gt t 0 (yt ; yt 0 ) (cid:0) 1 ; ft ; t 0g 2 E ;
:= qt (yt ; x j
t 2 T :
t ) (cid:0) 1 ;

and go to Step 2.

Since Algorithm 2 is nothing but the perceptron algorithm applied to the particular set of lin-
ear constraints (18), the Novikoff ’s theorem (Novikoff, 1962) readily applies. Thus Algorithm 2
terminates in a ﬁnite number of iterations provided (18) is satisﬁable,
that is, if there exists a super-

4.3 Max-Sum Classiﬁer with a Strictly Trivial Equivalent

Problem 3 (Learning max-sum classi ﬁer with a strictly trivial equivalent from a consistent training
set). For a given training set L = f(x j ; y j ) 2 X T (cid:2) Y T j j 2 J g ﬁnd quality functions q and g such
that equations (16) are satisﬁed and the max-sum problems P j = (T ; E ; Y ; q; g; x j ), j 2 J have a
strictly trivial equivalent.

In Problem 3, we again search for a max-sum classiﬁer which classiﬁes all training examples
correctly but, in addition, all max-sum problems P j , j 2 J should have a strictly trivial equivalent.
This means that if we compute a response of a max-sum classiﬁer which solves Problem 3 for each
training example using LP relaxation we get a unique labeling equal to that in the training set.
Because the equivalent transformations (4) cover the whole class of equivalent problems, the
problem P = (T ; E ; Y ; q; g; x) has a strictly trivial equivalent if and only if there exist potentials
jjj such that Pjjj is strictly trivial. Recall that the strictly trivial problem has unique maximal nodes
and edges (cf. Deﬁnition 2). Consequently, if the problem P has a strictly trivial equivalent and
its optimal solution is y(cid:3) then there must exist potentials jjj such that the following set of linear
inequalities holds

Note, that (19) is a set of jT jjY j + jE jjY j2 strict inequalities which are linear in (q, g) and jjj
as can be seen after substituting (4) to (19). By replicating (19) for max-sum problems P j =
(T ; E ; Y ; q; g; x j ), j 2 J whose unique solutions are required to be y j , j 2 J we obtain an equivalent
formulation of Problem 3 which requires satisfaction of a set of strict linear inequalities

The system (20) is to be solved with respect to the quality functions (q, g) and the potentials jjj j ,
j 2 J introduced for each P j , j 2 J . Note that the number of inequalities in the problem (20) is
substantially smaller compared to the learning of a general max-sum classiﬁer . In particular, (20)
contains only mjT j(jY j (cid:0) 1) + mjE j(jY j2 (cid:0) 1) inequalities compared to m(jY jjT j (cid:0) 1) for a general
max-sum classiﬁer . Therefore a violated inequality in (20) can be easily selected by an exhaustive
search. The proposed variant of the perceptron to solve (20) is as follows:

By the Novikoff ’s theorem, Algorithm 3 terminates in a ﬁnite number of iterations provided
f ((cid:15); q; g) with zero empirical risk on
(20) is satisﬁable,
that is, if there exists a max-sum classiﬁer
L and all max-sum problems P j = (T ; E ; Y ; q; g; x j ), j 2 J have a strictly trivial equivalent.

5. Learning a Max-Sum Classi ﬁer from an Inconsistent Training Set

In this section, we formulate problems of learning max-sum classiﬁers from an inconsistent training
set using the SVM framework described in Section 3.2. We will formulate the learning problems
for a general max-sum classiﬁer , a supermodular max-sum classiﬁer , and a max-sum classiﬁer with
a strictly trivial equivalent. In all cases, learning will amount to solving an instance of a convex QP
task. In Section 6, we will propose an extended version of the cutting plane algorithm (Tsochan-
taridis et al., 2005) which can solve these QP tasks efﬁciently .
In Section 4, we showed that learning of max-sum classiﬁers
can be expressed as satisfying
a set of strict linear inequalities. In the case of an inconsistent training set, however, these linear
inequalities become unsatisﬁable. Therefore we augment linear inequalities with non-negative slack
variables, which relaxes the problem and makes it always satisﬁable.
In analogy to the SVM,
we will minimize the Euclidean norm of an optimized parameters and the sum of slack variables.
The problems are formulated in such a way that the sum of slack variables is a piece-wise linear
upper bound on the empirical risk for a certain loss function. We will consider two different loss
functions. In case of a general max-sum classiﬁer and a supermodular max-sum classiﬁer , we will
use the additive loss function LD (y; y0 ) = (cid:229)t 2T Lt (yt ; y0
t ) where Lt : Y (cid:2) Y ! R is any function which
satisﬁes Lt (y; y0 ) = 0 for y = y0 and Lt (y; y0 ) > 0 otherwise. The Hamming distance LD (y; y0 ) =
(cid:229)t 2T [[y 6= y0 ]] is the particular case of the additive loss which seems to be a reasonable choice
in many (not necessarily all) applications. In case of a max-sum classiﬁer with a strictly trivial
equivalent, we will consider the 0=1-loss function L0=1 (y; y0 ) = [[y 6= y0 ]]. The 0=1-loss function
penalizes equally all incorrect predictions regardless of how many labels are misclassiﬁed. The
additive loss is preferable to the 0=1-loss function in most structured classiﬁcation problems. On the
other hand, there are applications for which the 0=1-loss function is a natural choice, for example,
problems with small number of objects like the one presented in Section 7.2.

The QP task (21) ﬁts
to the formulation (13) of structured SVM learning with the max-sum clas-
(1) plugged in. The number of optimized parameters (q; g) 2 Rd equals to d = jX jjY jjT j +
siﬁer
jY j2 jE j. The main difﬁculty in solving (21) stems from the huge number n = mjY j jT j of the linear
inequalities (21b) which deﬁne the feasible set.
For a later use, it is convenient to rewrite the QP task (21) using a compact notation

QP (w; xxx) = argmin

each i 2 I has assigned an unique pair ( j; y), j 2 J , y 2 Y T ; the vector w = (q; g) 2 Rd comprises
both the optimized quality functions and (z i 2 Rd ; bi 2 R), i 2 I , are constructed correspondingly
to inscribe the inequalities (21b).
In Section 6, we will introduce a variant of the cutting plane algorithm to solve the QP task (21)
(or (22), respectively). The cutting plane algorithm requires a subroutine which solves the LAC
task (15). Using the compact notation, the LAC task reads u j = argmaxi2I j (bi (cid:0) hw; zi i). Since this
is NP-complete in general, we will use an LP relaxation which solves the task approximately. We
will show that it is possible to assess the quality of the found solution (w; xxx) in terms of the objective
of the learning task, that is, it is possible to bound the difference QP (w; xxx) (cid:0) QP (w(cid:3) ; xxx(cid:3) ). Further,
we will prove that when the LAC task is solved exactly then the cutting plane algorithm ﬁnds an
arbitrary precise solution QP (w; xxx) (cid:0) QP (w(cid:3) ; xxx(cid:3) ) (cid:20) e, e > 0, after a ﬁnite number of iterations. This
guarantee does not apply for learning of the general max-sum classiﬁer when an LP relaxation
providing only an approximate solution is used. Though there is no theoretical guarantee, we will
experimentally show that using an LP relaxation is sufﬁcient
to ﬁnd a practically useful solution.

Compared to the task (21) of learning a general max-sum classiﬁer , the task (23) deﬁned for the
supermodular max-sum classiﬁer
contains additional linear constraints (23c). The added con-
straints (23c), when satisﬁed, guarantee that the found quality function g is supermodular. The
total number of constraints increases to n = mjY j jT j + jE j(jY j (cid:0) 1)2 . A compact form of the QP
task (23) reads

where bi = 0, i 2 I0 , and zi , i 2 I0 , account for the added supermodular constraints (23c).
In Section 6, we introduce a variant of the cutting plane algorithm which maintains the con-
straints (23c) satisﬁed. Thus the quality functions are always supermodular and the LAC task can
be solved precisely by efﬁcient polynomial-time algorithms. As a result, we can guarantee that
the cutting plane algorithm ﬁnds a solution with an arbitrary ﬁnite precision in a ﬁnite number of
iterations.

The problem (25) is derived from the problem (20) which was formulated for a consistent training
set. In the consistent case, it is required that each max-sum problem P j has a strictly trivial equiva-
lent whose unique solution equals to the desired labeling y j given in the training set. In the case of
an inconsistent training set, we allow some max-sum problems to violate this requirement. To this
end, each subset of linear inequalities in (25b) which corresponds to the given max-sum problem
P j is relaxed by a single non-negative slack variable x j . If a slack variable x j (cid:21) 1 then either the
solution of the max-sum problem P j differs from y j or P j has no trivial equivalent. The number of

84

D I SCR IM INAT IV E L EARN ING O F MAX -SUM C LA S S I FIER S

j2J x j which is included into the objective function
such max-sum problems is upper bounded by (cid:229)m
of (25a). Thus it corresponds to minimization of an upper bound on the empirical risk with the 0=1-
loss functions. The objective function also contains the Euclidean norm of the quality functions
(q, g) and the potentials jjj j . Including the potentials jjj j into the objective function is somewhat
arbitrary since it penalizes the transformation of max-sum problems to their trivial equivalents. An
advantage of including the potentials is the fact that the dual representation of the task (25) has a
simpler form which corresponds to the QP task of an ordinary multi-class SVM. Another variant is
to remove the potentials from the objective function which corresponds to including a set of linear
constraints to the dual task of (25) making the problem more difﬁcult.
Compared to the previous learning problems, the number of variables d = jX jjY jjT j + jY j 2 jE j +
2mjE jjY j in (25) is increased by 2mjE jjY j, however, the number of linear constraints n = mjE j(jY j 2 (cid:0)
1) + mjT j(jY j (cid:0) 1) + m is drastically smaller. In particular, n grows only polynomially compared
to the exponential growth in the previous cases.
The QP task (25) can be rewritten into the compact form (22), that is, the same QP task as
required when learning the general max-sum classiﬁer . Unlike the general case, the optimized
parameters w now comprise w = (q; g; jjj1 ; : : : ; jjjm ) 2 Rd and the vectors zi , i 2 I , are constructed
correspondingly. However, as mentioned above, the main difference is much smaller n = jI j. As
a result, the LAC task required by the cutting plane algorithm can be easily accomplished by an
exhaustive search.

6. Algorithm for Quadratic Programming Tasks

In this section, we propose an algorithm to solve the QP tasks (21), (23) and (25) required for learn-
ing the max-sum classiﬁers
from inconsistent training sets. We extend the cutting plane algorithm
by Tsochantaridis et al. (2005) and its approximate version by Finley and Joachims (2005) in two di-
rections. First, we will consider a more general QP task (23) which contains linear inequalities both
with and without slack variables. Moreover, the inequalities without slack variables are required
to be satisﬁed during the whole course of the algorithm. This extension is necessary for learning
a supermodular max-sum classiﬁer . Second, we propose to use a different stopping conditions to
halt the algorithm. The original algorithm by Tsochantaridis et al. (2005) halts the optimization
as soon as the linear constraints of a QP task are violated by a prescribed constant e > 0 at most.
We will use a stopping condition which is based on the duality gap. This allows us to control the
precision of the found solution directly in terms of the optimized objective function. Moreover, the
stopping condition can be easily evaluated even when the LAC task is solved only approximately
by an LP relaxation which is useful for learning general max-sum classiﬁers. Finally, we will prove
that the proposed algorithm converges in a ﬁnite number of iterations even in the case of a general
max-sum classiﬁer where the LAC task is NP-complete. We point out that the proof is similar to
that of Tsochantaridis et al. (2005) but is technically simpler and it applies for the extended cutting
plane algorithm proposed here. A general QP task which covers all the QP tasks (21), (23) and (25)
reads

QP (w; xxx) = argmin

Note that the vectors zi , i 2 I appear in (27) only as dot products and thus the kernel functions can
be potentially used.
It is not tractable to solve the QP task directly neither in the primal form nor in the dual form
due to the exponential number of constraints or variables, respectively. The cutting plane algorithm
alleviates the problem by exploiting the sparseness of maximal margin classiﬁers. Sparseness means
that only a small portion of constraints of the primal task are active in the optimal solution, or
equivalently, a small portion of dual variables are non-zero.
We denote I = I0 [ I 1 [ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) [ I m disjoint subsets of selected indices from I = I0 [ I1 [ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) [ Im ,
that is, I j (cid:18) I j , j 2 J , while I0 is always the same. The reduced task is obtained from (27) by
considering only the selected variables fa i j i 2 I g while the remaining variables fai j i 2 I n I g are
ﬁx ed to zero, that is, the reduced dual QP task reads

thus its size scales only with jI j. The cutting plane algorithm tries to select the subsets I =

QP (w; xxx) (cid:0) QD (aaa) (cid:20) e ;
or if the condition (30) was violated for all j 2 J then halt. Otherwise go to Step 2.
Note that Algorithm (4) explicitly maintains only the selected variables fa i j i 2 I g and the
corresponding pairs f(bi ; zi ) j i 2 I g. In Step 3a, the algorithm requires a subroutine to solve the
LAC task (29). We consider two different variants of the algorithm. First, the task (29) can be solved
precisely which applies to learning of supermodular max-sum classiﬁers and max-sum classiﬁers
with a strictly trivial equivalent. Second, the task (29) can be solved only approximately, which
applies to the general case when the max-sum problem is solved by an LP relaxation. The key
property of an LP relaxation which we exploit here is that it provides an upper bound on the optimal
solution of a max-sum problem, that is, an upper bound on the quantity b u j (cid:0) hw; zu j i.
In Step 3b, the condition (30) is evaluated to decide whether adding the constraint hw; z u j i (cid:21)
bu j (cid:0) x j to the reduced QP task (28) brings a sufﬁcient
improvement or not. In Lemma 1 introduced
below, we show that adding at least one constraint guarantees a minimal improvement regardless
of whether the LAC problem is solved precisely or approximately. The algorithm halts when no
constraint is added in Step 3b. This situation occurs only if the algorithm has converged to a solution
which satisﬁes
the stopping condition (31) provided the LAC task is solved exactly (cf. Theorem 4
and its proof).
Let us discuss the stopping condition (31). Note that the primal (w; xxx) and the dual variables
aaa are feasible during entire progress of the algorithm. This holds even in the case when an LP
relaxation is used to solve (29) since the x
j , j 2 J are set to upper bounds on their optimal values.
Having feasible primal and dual variables, we can use the weak duality theorem to write
QP (w; xxx) (cid:0) QP (w(cid:3) ; xxx(cid:3) ) (cid:20) QP (w; xxx) (cid:0) QD (aaa) ;
which implies that any solution satisfying the stopping condition (31) differs from the optimal so-
lution by at most e. Note that the precision parameter e used in the original stopping condition of
Tsochantaridis et al. (2005) can also be related to the duality gap. Namely, it can be shown that e
approximate solution satisﬁes QP (w; xxx) (cid:0) QD (aaa) (cid:20) Ce.
Finally, we show that the algorithm converges in a ﬁnite number of iterations. The proof is based
on Lemma 1 which asserts that a minimal improvement Dmin > 0 of the dual objective function is
guaranteed provided at least one new variable was added in Step 3(b) to the reduced task, that is,
the condition (30) was satisﬁed for at least one j 2 J .

Proof Algorithm 4 halts if either the stopping condition (31) holds or no new variable was added
in Step 3(b). Provided the algorithm does not halt in Step 4, the dual objective functions QD (aaa) is
improved by at least Dmin > 0 which is given in Lemma 1. Since the difference QD (aaa(cid:3) ) (cid:0) QD (aaa1 )
is bounded from above the algorithm cannot pass through the Step 4 inﬁnite number times and we
can write

T (cid:20)

The bound on a maximal number of iterations (or the bound on Dmin , respectively) given in
Theorem 4 is obtained based on the worst case analysis. As a result, the bound is an over-pessimistic
estimate of the number of iterations usually required in practice. Because the bound is not useful for
computing practical estimates of the number of iterations, we do not derive its particular variants
for the QP tasks (21), (23) and (25).
Finally, we give a theorem which asserts that the stopping condition (31) is always satisﬁed after
Algorithm 4 halts provided the LAC task (29) is solved exactly, that is, the found solution achieves
the desired precision QP (w; xxx) (cid:0) QP (w(cid:3) ; xxx(cid:3) ) (cid:20) e.

Theorem 5 Let us assume that the LAC task (29) is solved exactly and the assumptions of Theo-
rem 4 hold. In this case the condition (31) holds after Algorithm 4 halts.

Proof We show that the assumption that no new variable was added in Step 3(b) and the condi-
tion (31) is violated leads to a contradiction. If no variable was added then the condition (30) is
violated for all j 2 J . Summing up the violated conditions (30) yields

The last inequality can be equivalently written as QP (w; xxx) (cid:0) QD (aaa) (cid:20) e which is in contradiction
to the assumption that (31) is violated.

To summarize, in case when the LAC task (29) is solved exactly Algorithm 4 ﬁnds a solution
with an arbitrary ﬁnite precision e > 0 in a ﬁnite number of iterations. In case when the task (29) is
solved only approximately by an LP relaxation Algorithm 4 always halts after a ﬁnite number of iter-
ations but there is no guarantee that the desired precision was attained. The attained precision, how-
ever, can be determined by evaluating the duality gap QP (w; xxx) (cid:0) QD (aaa) (cid:21) QP (w; xxx) (cid:0) QP (w(cid:3) ; xxx(cid:3) ).
In next sections, we will apply Algorithm 4 to the three particular instances of the QP tasks (21), (23)
and (25).

6.1 General Max-Sum Classi ﬁer

In this section, we discuss optimization of the QP task (21) (or its compact form (22), respectively)
using Algorithm 4.
In Step 1 of Algorithm 4, we have to select the initial subsets (I j = fu j g; u j 2 I j ); j 2 J . A
simple way is to use u j = ( j; y j ), which is equivalent to selecting the primal constraints hw; z i i (cid:21)
bi (cid:0) x j with zi = 0 and bi = 0. Note that the task (21) does not contain the primal constraints without
slack variables which implies that the subset I0 = f /0g.
The LAC task (29) required in Step 2a of Algorithm 4 amounts to solving an instance of a
general max-sum problem
y2Y T (cid:20)LD (y; y j ) (cid:0) F (x j ; y j ; q; g) + F (x j ; y; q; g)(cid:21)

The obtained labeling ˆy j is then used to construct the vector z( j; ˆy j ) = Y(x j ; y j ) (cid:0) Y(x j ; ˆy j ). Because
the task (34) is NP-complete in general, we use an LP relaxation discussed in Section 2.1. This

means that the found ˆy j is not optimal but it is usually good enough to satisfy the condition (30)
which then leads to a guaranteed improvement of the optimized dual objective (cf. Lemma 1). LP
relaxation algorithms also provides an upper bound UB j on the optimal solution of (34) which is
essential to compute feasible x
j , j 2 J in Step 3(a) of Algorithm 4. In particular, x
j is computed as
x
j = UB j (cid:0) F (x j ; y j ; q; g).

6.2 Supermodular Max-Sum Classiﬁer

In this section, we discuss optimization of the QP task (23) (or its compact form (24), respectively)
using Algorithm 4.

The initialization in Step 1 of Algorithm 4 can be carried out in the same way as described in
Section 6.1. Since the QP task (24) involves the primal constraints hw; z i i (cid:21) bi , i 2 I0 , without slack
variables the corresponding zi , i 2 I0 , must be included in the reduced QP task during the entire
progress of Algorithm 4. The size jI0 j = jE j(jY j (cid:0) 1)2 grows only quadratically which allows to
use standard optimization packages.

The LAC task (29) is of the same form as that for a general max-sum problem, that is, it requires
solving (34). Unlike the general case, the task (34) can be solved exactly by a polynomial-time
algorithms provided the quality functions g obey the supermodularity condition. The requirement of
supermodularity is expressed by the primal conditions hw; z i i (cid:21) 0, i 2 I0 which are always included
in the reduced task (28) and thus they should be always satisﬁed. There is one numerical issue,
however, concerning a ﬁnite precision of QP solvers used to optimize the reduced task. It is possible
that the primal constraints on supermodularity are slightly violated even if the reduced task is solved
with a high precision. This might potentially (even though we have not observed the problem in
practice) cause problems when solving the LAC task which relies on the supermodularity of g.
An easy solution to avoid the problem is to add the primal constraints hw; z i i (cid:21) 0, i 2 I0 with w =
ai zi to the dual reduced task (28). In particular, we can solve the reduced task (28) subject to the
(cid:229)i2I
aiHi j (cid:21) 0 ;
constraints (28b) augmented by additional constraints (cid:229)i2I
j 2 I0 . Note that adding of
the additional constraints changes just the feasible set but it does not change the solution. Solving the
reduced task with the added constraints by using any QP solver which produces a feasible solution
with a ﬁnite precision (e.g., interior point methods) guarantees that the supermodularity constraints
are satisﬁed.

6.3 Max-Sum Classiﬁer with Strictly Trivial Equivalent

Unlike the previous two cases, the QP task (25) (or its compact form (22) respectively) contains
only n = mjE j(jY j2 (cid:0) 1) + mjT j(jY j (cid:0) 1) + m linear constraints. The form of the QP task (25)
is the same as required for learning of an ordinary multi-class SVM (Crammer and Singer, 2001)
which makes it possible to use existing optimization packages. The problem can be also solved by
the proposed Algorithm 4. In this case, an initialization of the subset (I j = fu j g; u j 2 I j ); j 2 J
performed in Step 1, can simply select the indices which correspond to the constraints x j (cid:21) 0, j 2 J .
The LAC task (29) required in Step 3a can be solved exhaustively which means that we do not need
any max-sum solver during the learning stage.

7. Experiments

Even though this article focuses primarily on theory, we present some examples to demonstrate
functionality of the proposed learning algorithms. The examples are not meant to be a comprehen-
sive evaluation.

We consider the problem of learning a classiﬁer
general max-sum classiﬁer , a supermodular max-sum classiﬁer
and a standard multi-class SVMs
classiﬁer
(Crammer and Singer, 2001) as a baseline approach. In particular, we used the formula-
tions given in Problem 4 and Problem 5 for learning the general and supermodular classiﬁers
from
the inconsistent training sets. To solve the LAC task required by Algorithm 4, we used an LP re-
laxation solver based on the Augmented Directed Acyclic Graph (ADAG) algorithm (Schlesinger
1976; see also the tutorial by Werner 2007).
We used the following three sets of color images (see Figure 1):

Microsoft Research (MSR) database: The original database 1 contains 240 images of 9 objects
along with their manual segmentation. We selected a subset of 32 images each of which
contains a combination of the following four objects: cow, grass, water and void. All images
are of size 213 (cid:2) 320 pixels. We created 3 random splits of the images into 10 training, 9
validation and 13 testing images. Reported results are averages taken over these three splits.

Shape-Sorter: We collected snapshots of a toy shape-sorter puzzle placed on a carpet. The snap-
shots are taken under varying view-angle and lighting conditions. The images contain 6
objects of different colors which we manually segmented. We split the images into a training
set containing 14 images of size 100 (cid:2) 100 pixels, validation and testing sets each containing
4 images of size 200 (cid:2) 200 pixels.
Landscape: The data set is created from a single landscape image of size 280 (cid:2) 600 which was
manually segmented into sky, border line and ground areas. We divided the landscape image
into 20 non-overlapping sub-windows of size 70 (cid:2) 120 pixels. Finally, we split the 20 images
into 5 training, 4 validation and 11 testing images.

In this experiment we deﬁne the max-sum classiﬁer as follows. The set of objects T = f(i; j) j
i 2 f1; : : : ; H g; j 2 f1; : : : ;W gg corresponds to the pixels of the input image of size H (cid:2) W . We
consider a 4-neighborhood structure of image pixels, that is, E contains undirected edges between
all pixels (i; j) 2 T and (i0 ; j 0 ) 2 T which satisfy ji (cid:0) i0 j + j j (cid:0) j 0 j = 1. Each pixel t 2 T is char-
acterized by its observable state xt and a label yt . The observable state xt 2 X = R3 is a vector
containing RGB color values of t -th pixel. The label yt 2 Y = f1; : : : ; N g assigns t -th pixel to one
of N segments. We assume that the
