Abstract—The  increase  in  availability  and  popularity  of 
mobile wireless  devices  has  lead  researchers  to  develop  a  wide 
variety  of Mobile  Ad-hoc  NETworking  (MANET)  protocols  to 
exploit  the  unique  communication  opportunities  presented  by 
these  devices.  Devices  are  able  to  communicate  directly  using 
the  wireless  spectrum  in  a  peer-to-peer  fashion,  and  route 
messages  through  intermediate  nodes,  however  the  nature  of 
wireless  shared  communication  and  mobile  devices  result  in 
many routing and security challenges which must be addressed 
before  deploying  a  MANET.  In  this  paper  we  investigate  the 
range  of  MANET  routing  protocols  available  and  discuss  the 
functionalities  of  several  ranging  from  early  protocols  such  as 
DSDV  to more  advanced  such  as MAODV,  our  protocol  study 
focuses  upon  works  by  Perkins  in  developing  and  improving 
 
MANET  routing.  A  range  of  literature  relating  to  the  field  of 
MANET routing was identified and reviewed, we also reviewed 
literature on the topic of securing AODV based MANETs as this 
may  be  the  most  popular  MANET  protocol.  The  literature 
review  identified  a  number  of  trends  within  research  papers 
such  as  exclusive  use  of  the  random  waypoint  mobility  model, 
excluding  key  metrics  from  simulation  results  and  not 
 
comparing protocol performance against available alternatives.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 

Wireless  technologies  such  as  Bluetooth  or  the  802.11 
standards  enable  mobile  devices  to  establish  a  Mobile 
Ad-hoc  Network  (MANET)  by  connecting  dynamically 
through  the  wireless  medium  without  any  centralised 
structure  [1].  MANETs  offer  several  advantages  over 
traditional  networks  including  reduced  infrastructure  costs, 
ease  of  establishment  and  fault  tolerance,  as  routing  is 
performed  individually  by  nodes  using  other  intermediate 
network  nodes  to  forward  packets  [2],  this  multi-hopping 
reduces the chance of bottlenecks, however the key MANET 
 
attraction is greater mobility compared with wired solutions.  
There are a number of issues which affect the reliability of 
 
Ad-hoc  networks  and  limit  their  viability  for  different 
scenarios;  lack  of  centralised  structure  within  MANET 
requires that each individual node must act as a router and is 
responsible for performing packet routing  tasks;  this  is done 
using  one  or  more  common  routing  protocols  across  the 
 
MANET [3]. Performing routing tasks requires memory and 
computation power, however mobile devices feature physical 
size  and  weight  limitations  essential  for  their  mobility,  this

reduces  the  available  memory  and  computational  resources 
as well as limiting battery power.  
MANETs  containing  more  nodes 
require  greater 
processing  power,  memory  and  bandwidth  to  maintain 
accurate routing information; this introduces traffic overhead 
into the network as nodes communicate routing information, 
this in turn uses more battery power. 
Wireless 
technologies  use  a  shared  communication 
medium;  this  causes  interference  which  degrades  network 
performance  when  multiple  nodes  attempt  to  transmit 
 
simultaneously. 
as  Distributed 
such 
Techniques 
Coordination Function (DCF) are used to limit the impact of 
channel  contention  upon  network  performance,  DCF  uses 
carrier  sense  multiple  access  with  collision  avoidance 
(CSMA/CA) and channel switching to reduce interference [4] 
however larger MANETs feature more interference. 
The  mobility  of  nodes  is  also  a  major  factor  within 
MANETs due to limited wireless transmission range; this can 
cause the network topology to change unpredictably as nodes 
enter  and  leave  the  network  [5].  Node  mobility  can  cause 
broken  routing  links  which  force  nodes  to  recalculate  their 
routing information; this consumes processing time, memory, 
device  power  and  generates  traffic  backlogs  and  additional 
overhead traffic on the network [6]. 
Security  of  MANETs  is  another  major  deployment 
concern;  due  to  the  mobility  and  wireless  nature  of  the 
network malicious  nodes  can  enter  the  network  at  any  time, 
the security of the nodes and the data transmitted needs to be 
considered [7]. 
Due  to  these  issues  ad-hoc  networks  are  not  appropriate 
for  most  general  usage  of  mobile  devices,  where  internet 
access  is  the  key  requirement;  in  these  situations  wireless 
devices  typically  connect  into  the  wired  infrastructures 
through access points  (AP)  to  reduce  the unreliability of  the 
wireless domain [8].  
However  Ad-Hoc  networks  show  great  potential  in 
situations where  internet  access  is  not  a  key  requirement  or 
infrastructure  is  not  available;  including  disaster  or  military 
 
scenarios  or  in  low  power  wireless  sensor  networks  or 
vehicles  which  only  need  to  communicate  with  each  other 
[9].   
This paper is structured as follows; Section II discusses the 
core requirements of a MANET routing protocol, Section III

routing  principles,  Section

II.  LITERATURE REVIEW 

 

We  have  identified  several  pieces  of  key  literature  in  the 
 
field  of MANET  routing  protocols which  highlight  existing 
protocols as well as the current thinking within the field and 
 
 
the directions researchers are moving in the future.  
Reference  [3] proposes  that  an  effective MANET  routing 
protocol  must  be  equipped  to  deal  with  the  dynamic  and 
unpredictable  topology  changes  associated  with  mobile 
nodes,  whilst  also  being  aware  of  the  limited  wireless 
bandwidth and device power considerations which may lead 
to  reductions  in  transmission  range  or  throughput.  This  is 
expanded  upon by  [1] who  propose  that  in  addition  to  these 
core requirements; MANET routing protocols  should also be 
decentralized,  self-healing  and  self-organising  and  able  to 
exploit multi-hopping and load balancing, these requirements 
ensure  MANET  routing  protocols  ability 
to  operate 
autonomously. 
 

III.  MANET ROUTING PRINCIPLES  

The  first  pieces  of  literature we will  discuss  are  a  pair  of 
 
survey  papers  by  [1],  [8],  these  two  survey  papers  gather 
together information on the wide variety of MANET routing 
 
 
protocols  which  researchers  have  developed  to  meet  the 
challenges  of  MANET  routing,  many  of  which  feature 
different  methods  of  managing  the  issues  associated  with 
mobility.  
Reference [8] performed an extensive research survey into 
the  available  routing  protocols  and  attempted  to  categorise 
them  by  the  features  they  exhibit  and  provide  details  on  the 
core  protocols  of  each  category.  This  is  similar  to  work 
undertaken  by  [1] who  took  a  similar  approach  in  grouping 
routing  protocols  using 
the  categories;  geographical, 
multi-path,  hierarchical,  geo-cast  and  power  aware  routing 
protocols.  The  two  survey  papers  both  find  that  every 
protocol identified also fit into the core categories of; reactive, 
proactive  or  hybrid  routing  protocols  in  additional  to  any 
other characteristics they exhibit.  

A.  Proactive Routing  

Proactive protocols rely upon maintaining routing tables of 
known destinations, this reduces the amount of control traffic 
overhead  that  proactive  routing  generates  because  packets 
 
are  forwarded  immediately  using  known  routes,  however 
routing tables must be kept up-to-date; this uses memory and 
nodes periodically send update messages to neighbours, even 
when no traffic is present, wasting bandwidth [10]. Proactive 
routing  is  unsuitable  for  highly  dynamic  networks  because 
routing  tables  must  be  updated  with  each  topology  change, 
this leads to increased control message overheads which can 
degrade network performance at high loads [11]. 

B.  Reactive Routing  

Reactive Protocols use  a  route discovery process  to  flood 
the network with route query requests when a packet needs to 
be  routed  using  source  routing  or  distance  vector  routing. 

 
Source  routing  uses  data  packet  headers  containing  routing 
information‎ meaning‎ nodes‎ don’t‎ need‎ routing‎ tables;‎
however  this  has  high  network  overhead.  Distance  vector 
routing  uses  next  hop  and  destination  addresses  to  route 
packets, this requires nodes to store active routes information 
until no longer required or an active route timeout occurs, this 
prevents  stale  routes  [10].  Flooding  is  a  reliable  method  of 
disseminating information over the network, however it uses 
bandwidth  and  creates  network  overhead,  reactive  routing 
broadcasts routing requests whenever a packet needs routing, 
this  can  cause  delays  in  packet  transmission  as  routes  are 
calculated,  but  features  very  little  control  traffic  overhead 
and  has  typically  lower  memory  usage  than  proactive 
alternatives, this increases the scalability of the protocol [1].  

C.  Hybrid Routing  

Hybrid protocols combine features from both reactive and 
proactive  routing  protocols,  typically  attempting  to  exploit 
 
the  reduced  control  traffic  overhead  from  proactive  systems 
 
whilst  reducing  the  route  discovery  delays  of  reactive 
systems by maintaining some form of routing table [10]. 
The  two  survey  papers  [1],  [8]  successfully  collect 
information  from  a  wide  range  of  literature  and  provide 
detailed  and  extensive  reference  material  for  attempting  to 
deploy  a MANET, both papers  reach  the  conclusion  that  no 
single  MANET  routing  protocol  is  best  for  every  situation 
meaning  analysis  of 
the  network  and  environmental 
requirements  is  essential  for  selecting  an  effective  protocol.  
Whilst these papers contain functionality details for many of 
the  protocols  available,  performance  information  for  the 
different  protocols  is  very  limited  and  no  details  of  any 
testing  methodologies  is  provided,  because  of  this  the 
validity of some claims made cannot be verified.  
 
 

IV.  EARLY MANET ROUTING PROTOCOLS  

The  next  piece  of  literature  is  a  protocol  performance 
 
comparison  by 
[12]  which  compares 
the  proactive 
Destination  Sequenced  Distance  Vector  (DSDV)  protocol 
 
 
and  the  reactive  Dynamic  Source  Routing  (DSR)  protocol; 
these  protocols  were  developed  in  1994  and  were  amongst 
the  earliest  MANET  routing  protocols  identified  using  the 
previous survey papers.   

A.  Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) 

The proactive DSDV protocol was proposed by [13] and is 
based  upon  the  Bellman-Ford  algorithm  to  calculate  the 
shortest number of hops to the destination [11]. Each DSDV 
 
node  maintains  a  routing  table  which  stores;  destinations, 
next hop  addresses and number of hops as well  as  sequence 
numbers;  routing  table  updates  are  sent  periodically  as 
incremental  dumps  limited  to  a  size  of  1  packet  containing 
only new information [12].  
DSDV compensates for mobility using sequence numbers 
and  routing  table  updates,  if  a  route  update  with  a  higher 
sequence number is received it will replace the existing route 
thereby  reducing  the  chance of  routing  loops, when  a major 
 
topology change is detected a full routing table dump will be 
performed,  this  can  add  significant  overhead  to  the  network 
in dynamic scenarios [13].

B.  Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) 

A.  Ad-Hoc on-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) 

The  reactive  DSR  Protocol  was  developed  by  [14], 
operation  of  the  DSR  protocol  is  broken  into  two  stages; 
route  discovery  phase  and  route  maintenance  phase,  these 
phases are triggered on demand when a packet needs routing. 
 
Route discovery phase floods the network with route requests 
if a suitable route is not available in the route [12]. 
DSR uses a source routing strategy to generate a complete 
route to the destination, this will then be stored temporarily in 
nodes  route  cache  [15].  DSR  addresses  mobility  issues 
through  the  use  of  packet  acknowledgements;  failure  to 
receive  an  acknowledgement  causes  packets  to  be  buffered 
and  route  error  messages  to  be  sent  to  all  upstream  nodes. 
Route  error  messages  trigger  the  route  maintenance  phase 
which  removes  incorrect  routes  from  the  route  cache  and 
undertakes a new route discovery phase [14]. 

C.  Mobility Models  

Reference  [12]  compares  the  performance  of  DSR  and 
DSDV using simulations against 4 different mobility models; 
these  are  mathematic  models  which  control  the  motion  of 
nodes  around  the  simulation;  this  allows  researchers  to 
 
measure  the  effect  of  mobility  upon  the  routing  protocols 
 
performance.  Various  mobility  models  are  used  to  simulate 
different situations such as high speed vehicular networks or 
lower mobility ad-hoc conference users, however research by 
[15]  reveals  that  many  studies  perform  protocol  evaluation 
almost  exclusively  using  the  random  waypoint  mobility 
model. This  research  is  supported  by  findings  from  [2] who 
claim  that  the  random  waypoint  model  is  the  most  widely 
used mobility model, however discrepancies were  identified 
between  the  models  behaviour  and  real  world  scenarios 
where users  typically move  in groups, due  to  this  the model 
 
may not be appropriate for exclusive testing.  
Reference  [12]  performs  simulations  against  multiple 
mobility  models  using  networks  of  varying  sizes  up  to  100 
nodes;  this  increases  the  accuracy  and  reliability  of  the  data 
and reveals network performance under different conditions, 
the study revealed that DSR gave greater network throughput 
than DSDV in all tests. These findings cannot be considered 
conclusive  evidence  of  DSRs  superiority  because  the  study 
only  collected  network  throughput metrics;  this  information 
alone does not give an accurate representation of the network 
performance;  collection  of  other  metrics  such  as  packet 
delivery  ratio  or  end-to-end  delay  should  be  considered  as 
these are important metrics for evaluating performance.  
 

V.  SECOND GENERATION MANET ROUTING PROTOCOL – 
AODV  

Researchers  learned  many  lessons  from  early  MANET 
 
protocols such as DSR and DSDV, these lead to proposals for 
new  protocols  to  improve  performance,  one  of  the  most 
 
 
significant contributions to MANET routing was the Ad-hoc 
  
On-demand  Distance  Vector  (AODV)  protocol  which  was 
designed by [16] as an improvement upon previous work on 
the DSDV protocol with [13]. Reference [17] has produced a 
paper  discussing  the  protocols  functionality  and  testing  it 
against a number of criteria.   

AODV  utilises  sequence  numbers  and  routing  beacons 
from DSDV but  performs  route  discovery  using  on-demand 
 
route  requests  (RREQ);  the  same  process  as  the  DSR 
protocol  [17].  AODV  is  different  to  DSR  in  that  it  uses 
 
distance vector routing; this requires every node in the route 
to maintain a  temporary routing  table  for  the duration of  the 
communication.  AODV  has  improved  upon  the  DSR  route 
request  process  using  an  expanding  ring  search  mechanism 
based  upon  incrementing  time-to-live  (TTL)  to  prevent 
excessive RREQ  flooding  [2]. Nodes within  an  active  route 
record  the  senders  address,  sequence  numbers  and  source  / 
destination  IP  address  within  their  routing  tables,  this 
information  is  used  by  route  reply  (RREP)  to  construct 
reverse paths [11].  
AODV deals with node mobility using sequence numbers 
to identify and discard outdated routes, this is combined with 
route  error  (RERR)  messages  which  are  sent  when  broken 
links  are  detected,  RERR  packets  travel  upstream  to  the 
 
source informing nodes to delete the broken links and trigger 
new route discovery if alternative routes are not available [4]. 
Reference  [17]  discusses  the  core  principles  of  the 
protocol  but  provide  no  real  insight  into  possible  directions 
the protocol could take in the future,  the network simulation 
collects  data  on  a  number  of  important  metrics;  dropped 
packets,  transmission  and  receiving  throughput  (UDP  and 
TCP),  delay,  send  time  vs.  delay,  jitter  and  round  trip  time. 
These  metrics  are  all  important  for  quality  of  service 
considerations and useful indicators of network performance, 
however  the simulations are  run only using AODV protocol 
so no direct comparison between alternative protocols can be 
made,  the  simulation  topology  also  uses  a  uniform  random 
waypoint  mobility  model  of  16  nodes  which  as  discussed 
previously  in  Section  IV.  C  is  not  an  ideal  testing 
environment.  

B.  Expanding upon AODV  – Multicasting 

The  AODV  protocol  is  considered  by  some  researchers 
[17]  to  be  the  most  popular  MANET  routing  protocol,  this 
has lead to many variants and improvements being proposed 
by researchers to address some of the many issues of wireless 
 
MANETs.  
One  of  these  issues  was  the  lack  of  multicast  support  in 
early MANET routing protocols, including DSR, DSDV and 
AODV,  this  functionality  is  useful  for  communicating  with 
multiple  nodes  and  increased  available  routing  knowledge 
whilst  reducing  control  traffic  overheads  [18].  In  order  to 
address  this  issue  [18]  proposed  the  Multicast  Ad-hoc 
On-demand  Distance  Vector  (MAODV)  routing  protocol, 
this  protocol  builds  directly  upon  their  previous  work  on 
AODV  by  adding  support  for  multicast  operation  to  the 
protocol.  
The next piece of  literature  in our  review  is an evaluation 
of  the MAODV  protocol  produced  by  [19]  who  discuss  the 
technical  aspects  of  the  protocol  and  provides  a  number  of 
simulations  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  protocol  in 
scenarios such as long and short lived communications.   

1)  Multicast ad-hoc on-demand distance vector 
(MAODV) 

The  MAODV  protocol  shares  the  same  underlying 

3

 
 

International Journal of Information and Education Technology, Vol. 3, No. 1, February 2013

 
 

architecture as the AODV protocol with some modifications 
and  the  addition  of  Multicast  Activations  (MACT)  and 
Group  Hello  (GRPH)  messages,  each  node  also  maintains 
 
separate  unicast  and  multicast  routing  tables  [20].  When 
MAODV broadcasts RREQ messages onto the network they 
now support multiple destination IP addresses, each of these 
IP  addresses  will  reply  with  RREP  packets  as  per  AODV 
behaviour however upon receipt of a RREP packet the source 
will  send  a  MACT  to  the  destination  node  activating  a 
multicast  route.  Multicast  paths  are  added  to  a  multicast 
delivery  tree which  is  stored on  the  source;  this  tree  records 
all multicast destinations and allows the node to learn unicast 
destinations  from  the  tree without  broadcasting RREQ  [18]. 
The first node to join a multicast group becomes the leader of 
that  group  responsible  for  group  maintenance,  this  is  done 
using  by  broadcasting  GRPH  messages  which  contain  the 
leaders IP, these GRPH messages are used to synchronise the 
multicast  group  using  incrementing  sequence  numbers  [19]. 
Should  a  tree  group  member  become  disconnected  it  will 
attempt  to  reconnect  to  the  existing  tree  using  the  leader  IP 
and  re-synchronise  before  attempting  to  create  a  new  tree, 
this reduces network overhead.  
Reference  [19]  have  performed  a  wide  range  of 
simulations to test the performance of the MAODV protocol 
however a key limitation of their work is that they only used 
random  waypoint  mobility  model  in  testing,  as  discussed 
previously this mobility model alone has several  limitations. 
The simulations also  failed  to collect a number of  important 
performance metrics  such  as  network  throughput  and  didn't 
perform  any  performance  comparisons  with  other  multicast 
protocols  available  such  as  Lightweight  Adaptive Multicast 
(LAM) which were discussed in the literature.  
 

VI.  ISSUES OF AODV – SECURITY  

One  of  the  major  concerns  about  deploying  MANETs  is 
security; wireless networks have increased vulnerability to a 
wide  variety  of  security  threats  such  as  eavesdropping  and 
 
packet tampering compared to traditional wired networks [7]. 
The  original  AODV  protocol 
included  no  security 
 
 
 
 
mechanisms  meaning  that  it  is  vulnerable  to  attacks  which 
target  the  network  routing  protocol  functions  such  as 
sequence number or hop count manipulation [21]. In order to 
address this issue researchers developed a number of security 
and  authentication  schemes  for  MANETs  as  well  as 
extensions  of  AODV  designed  to  increase  security,  such  as 
Security-aware  Ad-hoc  On-demand  Distance  Vector 
(SAODV)  and  Adaptive  Secure  Ad-hoc  On-demand 
Distance Vector (A-SAODV). These protocols feature digital 
signing  of  routing  traffic  and  data  to  ensure  integrity  and 
authenticity.  

A.  Security-Aware Ad-Hoc on-Demand Distance Vector 
Routing Protocol (SAODV) 

We reviewed literature produced by [22] which performed 
a  comparison  of  three  routing  protocols;  AODV,  SAODV 
  
and  A-SAODV.  Security  issues  which  these  protocols 
address 
include  Message 
tampering  attacks,  Message 
 
dropping  attack  and  Message  replay,  also  known  as 
the wormhole  attack.  In  an  effort  to  guard  against  these 

attacks,  AODV  security  protocols  need  the  ability  to 
authenticate  and  confirm  the  identity  of  a  source. Protocols 
also  need  to  authenticate  the  neighbour  transmitting  the 
packet; message integrity must also be checked to ensure that 
messages  in  transit  have  not  been  modified  through 
accidental or malicious activity. Protocols need the ability to 
ensure  that nodes wishing  to  access network  resources have 
the  appropriate  access  rights  [22].  The  literature  includes 
performance  simulations  for  the  AODV,  SAODV  and 
A-SAODV  protocols  in  a  free-attack  scenario  where 
simulated  threats  attack  the  network.  However  the  AODV 
protocol features no security mechanisms meaning this is not 
a fair comparison; the results for AODV should only be used 
as  a  benchmark  for  comparison.  Simulations  collected  a 
number of important metrics but were only performed using a 
random waypoint mobility model with very high node speeds 
of  40m/s  limiting  the  applicability  of  the  results  in  a  real 
world scenario as not many networks feature such high node 
speeds. 
 

VII.  CONCLUSION 

In  this  paper  we  have  identified  and  reviewed  a  range  of 
literature  on  the  topic  of  MANET  routing  protocols,  our 
 
initial work discussed a pair of survey papers from which we 
identified  early  reactive  and  proactive  MANET  routing 
 
 
protocols. Our  review  focuses  upon  protocols  developed  by 
Perkins, namely  the Destination Sequenced Distance Vector 
(DSDV)  and Ad-hoc On-demand  Distance  Vector  (AODV) 
which researchers claim is the most popular MANET routing 
protocol.  Due  to  the  popularity  of  the  AODV  protocol  a 
number of variations and improvements on the core protocol 
have been proposed by researchers to address specific issues 
with the protocol.  
We  investigate  the  evolution  of  the  AODV  protocol  by 
reviewing  works  based  upon 
the  Multicast  Ad-hoc 
On-demand Distance Vector (MAODV), developed by  [18], 
this  protocol  adds  multicasting  support  to  the  core  AODV 
protocol.  A  number  of  researchers  highlighted  the  lack  of 
security mechanisms within the original AODV protocol as a 
major  concern  for  deployment  of  a  MANET.  We  reviewed 
literature  relating  to  the  security  of  the AODV  protocol  and 
proposed  modifications  with  the  aim  of  addressing  the 
security  issues  raised,  one  example  is  the  Security-aware 
Ad-hoc On-demand Distance (SAODV).  
A  common  theme  across  many  of  the  papers  we  have 
reviewed is the exclusive usage of random waypoint mobility 
model for simulations despite several researchers identifying 
limitations  with  this  approach  to  testing.  The  collections  of 
metrics  from  simulations  is  another  area  which  was 
highlighted  in  several  of  the  reviewed  papers,  researchers 
focus  upon  very  specific  metric  collection  but  exclude 
collection  of  core  metrics  such  as  network  throughput  or 
delay which are essential for understanding the performance 
of  a  protocol.  This  is  also  true  in  the  case  of  simulations 
which  perform  testing of protocols  in  isolation;  this  reduces 
the  applicable  value  of  the  results  because  they  cannot  be 
directly compared to available alternatives.  
Areas  for  future  work  include  reviewing  literature  which
