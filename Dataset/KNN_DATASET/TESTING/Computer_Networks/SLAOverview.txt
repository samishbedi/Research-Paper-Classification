Abstract: This paper provides an overview of  service-level agreements  in  IP networks.  It 
looks  at  the  typical  components  of  a  service-level  agreement,  and  identifies  three 
common approaches that are used to satisfy service level agreements in IP networks. The 
implications  of  using  the  approaches  in  the  context  of  a  network  service  provider,  a 
hosting service provider, and an enterprise are examined. While most providers currently 
offer  a  static  insurance  approach  towards  supporting  service  level  agreements,  the 
schemes that can lead to more dynamic approaches are identified.

1. Introduction 
A  Service  Level  Agreement  (SLA)  is  a  formal  definition  of  the  relationship  that  exists 
between  a  service  provider  and  its  customer.  A  SLA  can  be  defined  and  used  in  the 
context  of  any  industry,  and  is  used  to  specify  what  the  customer  could  expect  from  the 
provider,  the  obligations  of  the  customer  as  well  as  the  provider,  performance, 
availability  and  security  objectives  of  the  service,  as  well  as  the  procedures  to  be 
followed  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  SLA.  Service  level  agreements  are  often  used 
when  corporations  outsource  functions  considered  outside  the  scope  of  their  own  core 
competencies  to  third  party  service  providers.  The  operation  and  maintenance  of 
computer  networks  is  outsourced  by  many  companies  to  third-party  network  providers, 
making SLA support an important subject in the context of computer networks. 
 
This paper  looks at  the different approaches used  for supporting service  level agreements 
in  computer  networks,  specifically  in  the  context  of  networks  based  on  the  Internet 
Protocol.  In  the next section of  this paper, we  look at  the  typical components of a service 
level  agreement.  This  is  followed  in  Section  3  by  a  description  of  some  common 
environments  of  IP  networks  where  service  level  agreements  play  an  important  role. 
Section  4  examines  the  different  approaches  that  are  used  by  different  organizations  in 
order  to  meet  the  obligations  of  their  service  level  agreements  in  these  environments. 
Finally, we  summarize  the  status  of  service  level  agreement  support  in  IP  networks,  and 
identify areas for further research.  

2. Typical Components of SLAs 

A service level agreement would typically contain the following information:  
•  A  description  of  the  nature  of  service  to  be  provided:  It  includes  the  type  of 
service to be provided, and any qualifications of the type of service to be provided. 
In  the  context  of  IP  network  connectivity,  the  type  of  service  may  specify  the 

maintenance  of  network  connectivity, or  it may  include  additional  functions  such 
as  operation  and  maintenance  of  domain  name  servers,  dynamic  host 
configuration protocol servers, etc.  
•  The  expected  performance  level  of  the  service,  specifically  its  reliability  and 
responsiveness:  Reliability includes availability requirements; when is the service 
available,  and  what  are  the  bounds  on  service  outages  that  may  be  expected.  
Responsiveness  includes how  soon  the  service would be performed  in  the normal 
course of operations.  
•  The procedure  for reporting problems with  the service: This  includes  information 
about  the  person  to  be  contacted  for  problem  resolution,  the  format  in  which 
complaints  have  to  be  filed,  and  the  steps  to  be  undertaken  in  order  to  quickly 
resolve  the problem. The agreement would also  typically describe a  time-limit by 
which  a  reported  problem  would  be  responded  to  (someone  would  start  to  work 
on the problem) as well as how soon the problem would be resolved. 
•  The  time-frame  for  response  and  problem  resolution:  This  specifies  a  time-limit 
by  which  someone  would  start  investigating  a  problem  that  was  reported.  The 
start  of  the  investigation  is  typically  marked  by  a  representative  of  the  supplier 
contacting  the  customer  who  reported  the  problem  initially.  There  may  also  be  a 
time  limit  by  which  the  problem  would  be  resolved.  A  SLA  may  specify  that  a 
failed link would be recommissioned within 24 hours.  
•  The  process  for  monitoring  and  reporting  the  service  level  :  This  outlines  how 
performance  levels  are   monitored  and  reported,  i.e., who will do  the monitoring, 
what  types  of  statistics will  be  collected,  how  often would  they  be  collected,  and 
how  past/current  statistics  may  be  accessed.  Some  network  providers  may  allow 
the  customer  to  directly  access  part  of  the  network  through  a  network 
management tool. The customer would be typically provided access to monitoring 
and statistics information, but may not be allowed to modify the configurations or 
operation of the network.   
•  The  consequences  for  the  service  provider  not  meeting  its  obligations:    It  is 
customary  to  extend  some  credits  to  the  customers when  the  service  expectations 
are  not  met.  Other  consequences  of  not  meeting  the  obligation  may  include  the 
ability of the customer to terminate its relationship, or to ask for reimbursement of 
part  of  the  revenues  lost  due  to  loss  of  service. The  consequences  of  not meeting 
the  SLA  may  vary  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  relationship  between  the 
customer and the supplier.  
•  Escape  clauses  and  constraints:  Escape  clauses  are  conditions  under  which  the 
service  level does not apply, or under which  it would be considered unreasonable 
to  meet  the  requisite  service  level  agreements,  e.g.  when  the  service  provider’s 
equipment have been damaged in flood, fire or war. They often also impose some 
constraints  on  the  behavior  by  the  customer.  A  network  operator  may  void  the 

service  level agreement  if  the customer  is attempting  to breach  the  security of  the 
network. 
Not  all  of  the  components  of  a  SLA  may  be  present  in  all  contracts,  but  a  good  SLA 
would  provide  an  overview  of  the  different  items  that  can  go  wrong  with  the  provided 
service, and attempt to cover those situations as part of the SLA agreement.  

 

3. IP Network Environments 
Within  the  context  of  an  IP  networks,  SLAs  are  typically  provided  for  three  common 
types  of  operating  environments.  Each  of  these  environments  consists  of  service 
providers  offering  a  different  type  of  service  to  their  customers.  The  three  common 
services provided  in  IP networks are network connectivity services, hosting services, and 
integrated connectivity and hosting services. 

3.1 Network Connectivity Services  
Network connectivity  services are provided by  several  telecommunications companies  to 
large  enterprises.    They  provide  the  access  links  to  the  different  sites  of  its  customers, 
enabling customer sites to be connected to each other as an intranet, or provide the access 
to  the  global  Internet  from  the  customer’s  site.  Customer  networ ks  are  attached  to  the 
provider  network  via  access  routers  that  are  present  at  the  access  points.  A  typical 
scenario  is  shown  in  Figure  1.  For  each  customer,  the  network  operator  has  defined 
performance and availability limits in the appropriate SLA signed with the customer.

In this environment, typical clauses related to performance and availability may look like:   
 

•  The  average  delay  measured  monthly  across  the  ISP  network  between  any  two 
access routers of the customer should be less than 200 ms. 

•  The average delay across the ISP network between any access router in New York 
City to any access router of the customer within the US would be less than 200 ms.  
•  The  average  delay  across  the  ISP  network  on  the  transcontinental  link  between 
New York City access router of  the customer and  the London access router of  the 
customer would be less than 250 ms.  
•  The  customer  will  not  have  unscheduled  connectivity  disruption  across  the  ISP 
network  between  any  two  access  routers  exceeding  5  minutes.  Connectivity 
disruption  would  be  defined  as  the  loss  of  100%  of  packets  as  measured  by 
pinging an access router from a machine connected to another access router. 

 
By  offering  better  performance,  availability  and  responsive  customer  service  to  its 
customers,  a  network  provider  would  be  better  able  to  compete  with  its  rivals.  The 
resources within  the  network  are  provisioned  so  as  to meet  the  desired  performance  and 
availability  objectives,  thereby  reducing  the  operational  cost  without  impacting  the 
satisfaction of the customers receiving the connectivity service.  
 

3.2 Hosting Services 
Hosting  services  are offered by  operators  that host  and  support  different  types of  servers 
on  behalf  of  their  customers. The most  common  case  of  these  providers  are web-hosting 
companies,  e.g.  Verio  (www.verio.com)  or  SBC  web-hosting  (www.webhosting.com), 
that  manage  and  provide  servers  to  operate  the  web-sites  for  individual  companies. 
Hosting  operators  provide  a  variety  of  services  to  their  customers,  and  includes 
companies  that  simply  provide  cages  in  well-connected  locations  where  customers  may 
place  their  servers,  companies  that  provide  cages  and maintain  the  uptime  of  the  servers 
in  the  cages,  as  well  as  companies  that  take  responsibility  for  running  and  ensuring  the 
operation  of  the  entire  application  hosted  at  the  site.  The  last mode  of  providing  hosting 
services,  in which  the  provider  is  responsible  for  the  overall  operation  of  the  application 
being  hosted,  is  gaining  ground  as being more  attractive  to both  the  service provider  and 
the customer.

The  typical  scenario  for  hosting  services  is  shown  in  Figure  2.  The  SLAs  offered  by 
hosting  providers  deal  with  the  uptime  and  performance  of  the  servers  that  are  being 
hosted.  These  operators  are  only  able  to  control  the  server  side  of  the  total 

 

communication.  In  most  cases,  they  have  no  control  over  the  client  side  of  the 
communication,  nor  over  the  performance  of  the  network  (usually  the  Internet).    As  a 
result,  Service  Provider  SLAs  usually  specify  the  amount  of  sustained  throughput  or 
connection  request  rates  that needs  to be  supported  for  a  specific  server. This determines 
the  aggregated  number  of  requests  that  must  be  handled  by  the  server  with  acceptable 
performance.  In  the  hosting  environment,  typical  performance  and  availability  clauses 
that are provided to the customer may look like: 
 
 
•  The  hosted  server  will  not  be  unavailable  for  a  contiguous  period  exceeding  5 
minutes  in  any  24 hour period. Unavailability  is defined  as  the  ability  to ping  the 
server  from a machine with network connectivity  to  the hosting provider’ s  access 
router.  
•  The  hosted  server  will  be  able  to  handle  inbound  traffic  of  30,000  web-requests 
per day.  
•  The  hosted  application  will  be  provided  access  to  the  Internet  at  a  bandwidth  of 
45 Mbps or more.     
•  The  service  provider  will  ensure  that  there  are  at  least  5  servers  available  and 
running the application at all times.  

 
A  large  hosting  service  provider  may  host  multiple  customers  at  the  same  site,  and  thus 
would  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  performance  of  one  customer's  server  is  not 
adversely affected by requests directed to other customers.  

3.3 Integrated Services 
 
A  third  type  of  service  provides  a  consolidated  service  in  which  the  service  provider 
controls the network as well as the hosting infrastructure. Such a service is often provided 
by  an  enterprise  information  technology  (IT)  department  that  operates  and maintains  the 
intranet  of  an  enterprise  and  the  various  applications  that  run  within  that  environment. 
The  customers  of  the  IT  department  are  the  other  departments  of  the  enterprise.  Often 
times,  the  IT  department  is  in  charge  of  clients  as  well  as  servers  in  the  network,  and 
needs to control end-to-end performance of the different applications.  
In an integrated environment, customers would often expect performance and availability 
on  the operation of  the entire distributed  system. Some examples of performance  clauses 
that one may see within an enterprise IT context would look like: 
 

•  The  time  to  perform  an  employee  lookup  on  the  corporate  directory  would  not 
exceed 500 milliseconds.  
•  The  average  performance  of  a  standard  synthetic  web-based  transaction,  as 
reported by probes located at selected locations, will not exceed 100 milliseconds.  
•  Unscheduled  downtime  of  the  mail  server  will  not  exceed  a  30  minute  period 
during the normal business day of 9 AM to 5 PM.  

 
Another  type  of  integrated  service  is  offered  by  hosting  service  providers  which  would 
provide  an  integrated  hosting  and  connectivity  service  to  the  provider. As  an  example,  a 
networking  service  provider  like  AT&T  also  operates  data-centers,  and  could  offer  a 

consolidated  service  including  network  connectivity  and  data  center  hosting  to  its 
customers.  An  alternate  way  to  provide  an  integrated  service  may  be  outsourcing  some 
the hosting part or  the networking part  to another  company. As an  example,  IBM Global 
Services  may  offer  an  integrated  service  to  its  customers,  and  obtain  networking 
connectivity by outsourcing it to AT&T.  
 
In  all  of  the  above  operating  environments,  the  nature  of  the  service  being  provided  and 
the  performance/availability  objectives,  and  the  mechanism  used  to  monitor  the 
performance  level would  the  service are different. However,  the other components of  the 
service level agreements would tend to be relatively similar in all of those environments.  
 
The  procedure  for  reporting  problems with  the  service would  typically  describe whether 
the problem should be reported by calling a help-desk, or whether it can be reported via a 
web-based  interface.  The  help-desk  personnel  or  the web-interface may  attempt  to  solve 
the  problem  using  a  set  of  known  procedures,  or  open  a  problem  ticket  for  support 
personnel  to  try  to  solve  the  problem.  The  time-frame  for  response  and  problem 
resolution  clause  would  be  similar  across  the  different  environments,  and  would  dictate 
how  soon action would be  taken on  the problem  ticket. The escape clauses as well as  the 
penalties  to  be  paid  for  not  monitoring  the  service  would  also  be  expressed  in  similar 
terms.  
 

4. Approaches to SLA support 
 
Supporting  the  appropriate  level  of  performance  and  availability  specified  in  a  service 
level  agreement  is  an  important  aspect  of  the  operation  of  an  enterprise.  Since  the 
inability  to  meet  service  level  agreements  can  often  result  in  monetary  damages,  the 
provider  of  services,  regardless  of  the  specific  type  of  service  being  offered,  attempts  to 
meet the service level agreements to the best of their ability. 
 
A  service provider may  sign SLAs with difference performance objectives with different 
customers.  The  network  operator  needs  to  identify  the  type  of  packets  coming  into  the 
network,  so  that  they  can  be  dealt  with  appropriate  urgency.  Once  the  SLA  has  been 
agreed upon, the network operator needs to monitor the performance of the network.  The 
SLA would detemine which network performance metrics ought  to be monitored, as well 
as the operating ranges of the performance metrics.  
 
The  creation  and  filing  of  periodic  reports  is  an  important  step  in  the  process  of 
supporting  SLAs.  The  reports  on  monitored  performance  must  be  available  for 
examination by  the  customer. A  side-benefit of  storing  reports would be  that  the historic 
information can be used to extrapolate trends in network traffic, and thus be used as input 
to the service provisioning process.  
 
If  monitoring  indicates  that  all  the  SLAs  are  being  satisfied,  there  is  no  need  for  any 
further  action.  However,  one  may  want  to  check  if  it  would  be  possible  to  satisfy  the 
same  SLA  constraints  with  a  possibly  cheaper  or  simpler  configuration.  If  so,  the 

operational constraints of  the network might need  to be changed. A worse  case would be 
when  the SLA objectives are not being met.  In  this case,  the network configuration must 
be  changed,  through  the  service  provisioning  process,  so  that  the  objectives  can  be 
successfully met.  
 
As a last step of the customization process, one must examine if the agreed  SLAs can be 
satisfied.  If  experience  shows  that  the  SLAs  can  not  be met,  one may want  to  revise  the 
performance  objectives  to  those  that  are  feasible  to  meet.  One  can  also  revise  SLA 
objectives  to  become  more  stringent,  if  that  is  likely  to  attract  new  customers  and  new 
streams of revenues. 
 
Three  common  approaches  are  used  to  support  and  manage  service  level  agreements 
within  the  three  IP  environments  described  in  Section  3.  The  first  approach  takes  the 
model  of  an  insurance  company  towards  monitoring  and  supporting  SLAs.  The  second 
approach  uses  configuration  and  provisioning  techniques  to  support  SLAs  within  the 
network  and  the  third  approach  takes  a  more  dynamic  and  adaptive  approach  towards 
supporting service level agreements.  
 

Insurance Approach:  
In  the  insurance  approach  towards  supporting  SLAs,  the  service  provider  makes  its  best 
attempt  to  satisfy  the  performance,  availability  and  responsiveness  objectives  that  are 
specified  in  the  service  level  agreement  according  to  its  normal  operating  procedures. 
Generally,  the  same  level  of  service  is  offered  to  all  of  the  customers.    The  service 
provider  keeps  on  monitoring  its  service  to  check  how  well  it  is  complying  with  the 
objectives  set within  the  contract. The performance  and  availability parameters  specified 
within the SLA are specified so that they are not likely to be violated during the course of 
normal operation of  the  system. When  the  limits are violated,  the  service provider would 
pay  the  penalty  charges  specified  in  the  contract  to  the  customers.  Thus,  the  service 
provider is computing the financial risk associated with providing a given service level to 
a  new  customer,  and  revises  the  terms  offered  to  customers  when  the  financial  risk 
associated with  the  SLA  violation  is  unacceptable. The  computation  of  such  risk  is what 
most  companies  in  the  insurance  business  do,  and  this  approach  can  be  viewed  as  self-
insurance of a service provider against the risk of violating the service level objectives. It 
would  not  be  unreasonable  in  the  future  to  see  service  providers  take  out  explicit 
insurance policies against the possible violation of their service level objectives.  
 
In  other  words,  the  insurance  approach  towards  supporting  SLAs  can  be  summarized  as 
performing the following steps: 
 

 1.  Identify  service  objectives  (performance,  availability,  responsiveness)  to  be 
offered for the service.  
 2.  Monitor agreed-upon service objectives.  
 3.    Issue  SLA  reports,  possibly  including  periodic  meetings  with  the  customers  to 
discuss status of SLA compliance. 
4.  Issue appropriate credits to the customers if service levels are not being satisfied. 

5. Periodically, modify service  level objectives so  that  the probability of violating  the 
objectives and the associated financial impact is acceptable.  

 
A  description  of  a  network  architectures  that monitors  SLA  compliance  can  be  found  in 
[8].   

Provisioning Approach: 
In  the  provisioning  approach  towards  satisfying  service  level  agreements,  the  service 
provider  typically  signs  different  types  of  service  objectives  with  different  customers. 
The  service  provider  would  allocate  the  resources  within  the  environment  differently  to 
each  customer  in  order  to  be  able  to  support  the  service  level  objectives  for  each  of  the 
individual  customer.  The  determination  of  the  configuration  of  the  system  is  the  most 
crucial  step  towards  the  support of  service  level  objectives  for  each  individual  customer. 
Beyond this step, the service provider follows the same approach towards monitoring and 
payment  of  credits/penalties  to  the  customers  as  in  the  insurance  approach  described 
earlier. The provisioning approach can be summarized as the following steps 
 

1.  Identify  service  objectives  (performance,  availability,  responsiveness)  to  be 
provided to each customer. 
2. Determine the right system configuration to be used for each of the customers.    
3.  Monitor agreed-upon service objectives.  
4.    Issue  SLA  reports,  possibly  including  periodic  meetings  with  the  customers  to 
discuss status of SLA compliance. 
5.  Issue appropriate credits to the customers if service levels are not being satisfied. 

 

Adaptive Approach: 
The  third  approach  towards  satisfying  service  level  agreements  adds  on  an  additional 
aspect  of  adaptive  configuration  to  the  provisioning  approach.  In  this  approach,  the 
service  provider  would  dynamically  modify  the  configuration  of  the  system  used  to 
support  the  customer  when  monitoring  indicates  that  the  service  objectives  provided  to 
the customer are in the danger of being violated. This step reduces the probability that the 
service will  actually  be  violated,  but  does  not  eliminate  it  altogether. The  steps  involved 
in the adaptive approach are the following: 
 

1.  Identify  service  objectives  (performance,  availability,  responsiveness)  to  be 
provided to each customer. 
2. Determine the right system configuration to be used for each of the customers.    
3.  Monitor agreed-upon service objectives.  
4.  If  monitoring  indicates  possible  violation  of  objectives,  reconfigure  customer 
configuration to better server the service objectives.  
5.    Issue  SLA  reports,  possibly  including  periodic  meetings  with  the  customers  to 
discuss status of SLA compliance. 
6.  Issue appropriate credits to the customers if service levels are not being satisfied. 

 

We  can  now  map  the  above  three  approaches  to  each  of  the  three  types  of  services 
discussed in Section 3. 
 

4.1 Network Connectivity Services 
 
In  the  context  of  networking  SLAs,  the  insurance  approach  to  support  service  level 
agreements  is  the  most  prevalent  one  in  the  industry.  Service  providers  (ISP)  such  as 
UUNet  provide  assurances  on  the  availability  and  responsiveness  of  the  connectivity 
services  they  offer  to  their  enterprise  customers.  The  availability  and  responsiveness  can 
be  defined  in  a  variety  of ways,  the most  common metrics  being  the  delay  between  two 
access routers and the loss-rate between a pair of access routers.  
 
In  an  insurance  approach  towards  supporting  service  level  agreements,  the  ISP  will 
assure  an  upper  bound  on  the  delay  and  loss-rate  between  any  pair  of  access  routers, 
averaged across  all of  the access  routers and over a  reasonable duration of  time. The  ISP 
would  install  a monitoring  scheme  to measure  the  delay  and  loss-rate  among  the  access-
points.  Common  ways  of  measuring  the  performance  include  the  use  of  IP  pings  to 
collect  the delays between points  in  the network, as  exemplified  by  the data  collected by 
the  Surveyor  project  (http://www.advanced.org/surveyor/)  and  the  collection  of  network 
delays as measured by the protocol exchanges of NTP, the network time protocol. UUnet 
measures  monthly  averages  of  access  point  latencies,  offering  to  return  parts  of  service 
charges if the performance guarantees are not being satisfied [1].  
 
As  we  move  from  the  insurance  approach  to  the  provisioning  approach  of  SLAs, 
networking  connectivity  providers  would  need  to  offer  different  levels  of  service  and 
performance  to  different  customers.  For  a  networking  services  provider,  it  would  mean 
offering  a  service with  a  lower  latency  and  loss  rate  to  some  customers  in comparison  to 
others.  The  terms  of  SLAs  are  customized  for  different  customers.  In  the  context  of 
network connectivity, it means that a service provider would need to provide for different 
latencies  and/or  loss-rates  on  the  links  that  interconnect  different  customers  on  the  same 
link. A  customer  running  latency-critical  applications,  e.g. Voice over  IP  calls, on  the  IP 
network  may  desire  a  tighter  assurance  on  the  network  latency  than  one  running 
traditional computer applications. A monthly average for round trip delays is not likely to 
be  useful  for  VoIP  applications,  which  typically  require  an  absolute  maximum  delay 
bound  in  the  order  of  hundreds  of  milliseconds.  In  order  to  support  the  different 
requirements  of  different  customers,  network  service  providers  would  need  to  use 
techniques like Differentiated Services [2] or traffic engineering using MPLS [3] in order 
to  plan  the  networks  so  that  they  would  meet  the  requisite  performance  targets.  Such 
provisioning  of  systems  can  be  done  currently  using  capacity  planning  tools  and  circuit 
establishment schemes that typically tend to be manual.  
 
Future  technologies  on  the  horizon,  e.g.  dynamic  bandwidth  provisioning  in  optical 
networks  [4]  offers  the  ability  for  the  carrier  to  do  such  provisioning  in  an  automated 
manner. That would enable the network operator  to dynamically provide more bandwidth 
on  its circuits as  traffic carried on  specific  segments of  the network  increase. This would 

allow  the  network  connective  service  providers  to  move  towards  the  adaptive  approach 
for  providing  service  level  agreements.  Some  of  the  algorithms  to  support  an  adaptive 
approach can be found in [5].     
 

4.2 Hosting Services.  
 
In the context of hosting services, the service provider is mostly concerned with operating 
a  set  of  network  connected machines  that  are  hosting  an  application,  e.g.  a web-site  or  a 
mail-server.  The  main  aspects  of  service  level  agreements  that  are  provided  in  this 
context  deal  with  the  uptime  and  availability  of  the  service.  A  typical  SLA  in  this 
environment  would  offer  the  customer  an  assurance  that  service  will  not  be  down  for 
more  than a  specific period of  time. Generally,  if  the  service  is disrupted  for more  than a 
specific  amount  of  time,  the  provider  would  issue  credits  to  the  customer.  Some  sample 
SLAs that correspond to  the hosting environment can be seen in [9] and [10]. The uptime 
and  availability  constraints  provided  by  the  hosting  service  providers  tend  to  follow  the 
insurance model for supporting SLAs. The same  level of uptime and reliability assurance 
is  provided  to  all  of  the  customers,  and  when  unexpected  events  cause  the  performance 
objectives not to be met, credits are issued to the customer.  
  
Performance  based  service  level  agreements  are  typically  not  found  in  the  context  of 
hosting services. This  is because  the performance of an application depends upon several 
factors  that  are no within  the  control of  the hosting  service provider. The hosting  service 
provider  has  little  control  over  the  network  latency  connecting  potential  users  to  the 
service,  or  on  the  development  of  the  actual  application  itself.  As  a  result,  the  hosting 
service provider  is  not  able  to  influence  the performance of  the overall  application  itself. 
As a result, many hosting services provider only offer their customer co-location services, 
i.e.  the ability  to place machines  in a physical  facility,  and offer guarantees  related  to  the 
availability  of  the  network  connectivity  to  their  machines.  Other  hosting  services 
providers could also take over the administration of the servers, and their services include 
the  task  of  provisioning  the  appropriate  configuration  of  machines  needed  to  run  the 
applications. 
 
Co-location services are a type of hosting in which the provider is offering physical space 
(including  power  supply  and  network  access)  to  its  customer.  In  the  context  of  co-
location  services,  the  only  difference  in  contract  that  the  provider  can  offer  to  different 
customers would be in terms of the physical bandwidth available on the access link to the 
Internet.  The  provider  could  obtain  different  physical  access  links  for  the  different 
customers. Providers tend to follow an insurance model for such a physical access.  
 
When more  than  one  customer  is  preset  at  one  of  service  provider’s  premises,  it  is more 
economical  to  get  a  common  access  link  and  share  it  among  all  the  different  customers. 
The access  link could be controlled by  a  rate control device which provides  the ability  to 
reserve different  levels  of bandwidth  to different  set of machine  addresses. Such devices 
are  available  from  many  vendors,  both  small  and  large  in  the  industry.  The  rate-control 
device  is generally partitioned  statically  to provide  for  the different  rates negotiated with 

the different customers located at the service provider’s premi ses. The static provisioning 
of  a  shared  access  link  to  provide  different  levels  of  network  bandwidth  access  allows  a 
service provider to support the provisioning approach for supporting SLAs.   
 
With  any  shared  resource,  the  static  partitioning  into  shares  of  different  customers 
independent of usage,  is not  the optimal use of  the  shared  resource. For  the best usage of 
the  shared  resource,  the  network  resource  must  be  partitioned  dynamically  so  that  the 
resource  is  used  in  the  optimal  manner.  The  rate-control  algorithm  used  for  regulating 
access  link  bandwidth  can  thus  be  crucial  in  influencing  the  right  sharing  of  bandwidth 
among  the  different  customers.  Rate  control  algorithms  which  implement  only  a  leaky-
bucket  model  for  sharing  bandwidth  would  note  be  able  to  share  the  bandwidth  among 
the  different  users,  while  rate  control  algorithms  that  allow  the  use  of  excess  shared 
bandwidth  among  the  heavy  demand  users  would  tend  to  use  the  bandwidth  more 
effectively.   This allows  the  service provider  to move  to an  adaptive  approach  to  support 
SLAs. 
 
If  the  SLAs  signed  between  the  hosting  services  provider  and  the  customer  specify  a 
fixed  rate  of  access  bandwidth,  then  the  service  provider  would  not  be  changing  the 
parameters  at  the  rate  control  device  during  run-time.  However,  if  the  performance 
parameters  in  the  SLA  contract  specify  other  parameters  such  as  the  packet  loss  rate  in 
the  access  network,  then  the  service  provider  has  to  ensure  that  adequate  bandwidth  is 
allocated  to meet  the current demands of  the customers.  In  that case,  the service provider 
may  want  to  monitor  the  usage  of  the  access  link  and  periodically  update  the  shares 
allocated  to different  customers  in order  to keep  the  shared allocated  to each customer  in 
proportion to their current usage. 
 
Some hosting providers offer  services which manages  the  servers and applications of  the 
customer.  Most  hosted  systems  tend  to  follow  a  tiered  configuration,  in  which  the 
application  system  consists  of  multiple  tiers,  each  tier  consisting  of  multiple  servers 
performing  the  same  task.  As  an  example,  most  web-based  applications  tend  to  be 
implemented  in  three  tiers,  the  first  tier  consisting  of  HTTP  servers  (e.g.  Apache),  the 
second  tier  consisting  of  application  servers  (e.g.  IBM Websphere Application  Server  or 
tomcat),  and  the  third  tier  consisting  of  the  database  server. At  each  tier,  a  load  balancer 
may  be  used  to  distributed work  among  a  number  of  different machines.  The  number  of 
servers used at various  tiers has a strong  influence  in determining  the responsiveness and 
availability of the managed service.  
 
Hosting  service providers  that offer management  and provisioning of  servers  can use  the 
shared  resources  to  manage  the  performance  and  responsiveness  of  applications  that  are 
hosted  at  their  sites.  In  this  environment,  the  hosting  service  provider  can  follow  an 
adaptive  approach  to  support  SLAs,  dynamically  modifying  the  number  of  servers 
provided  to  each of  the  customers  in order  to meet  its performance objectives. However, 
adjusting  the  number  of  servers  would  require  the  service  provider  to  maintain  a  shared 
pool of servers from which it would be able to carve out the appropriate configuration for 
each  customer  as  needed.  The  creation  of  a  shared  pool  of  servers  and  providing 
customers  free  servers  to  access  from  that  pool  is  the  corner-stone  of  utility  based 

computing  initiatives  by  hosting  services  providers  such  as  HP  [6]  and  the  Oceano 
project [7].  
 

4.3 Integrated Services.  
 
Integrated  services  are  usually  offered  by  the  IT  (information  technology)  department  of 
an enterprise and have the unique ability to control the hosting environment as well as the 
network which connects the clients to the servers.  
 
SLAs offered by the IT department of most large corporations tend to follow an insurance 
approach.  The  IT  department  would  offer  appropriate  SLAs  and  provision  the  network 
connectivity within  the enterprise  intranet and  the  servers  running an  application  so as  to 
provide the desired level of application performance.  
 
To migrate  from  the  insurance  approach  of  supporting  service  levels  to  the  provisioning 
or  the reactive model,  the  integrated service provider has  the ability  to use a combination 
of  the  techniques  from  the networking  services provider  area  as well  as  from  the hosting 
services  provider  area. These  techniques  used  for  this  purpose would  include  the  task  of 
maintaining  a  shared  set  of  resources,  and  then  trying  to  adapt  the  set  of  resources 
allocated to each application/customer in a manner best suited to support the service level 
agreements  that  are  in  place.  A  combination  of  the  adaptation  techniques  within  the 
network and ones at hosted application sites can be used.  
  

5. Conclusions and Future Areas of work. 
 
In  this  paper,  we  have  provided  an  overview  of  the  different  techniques  and  approaches 
that  can  be  used  to  support  the  notion  of  service  level  agreements  in  IP  networks.  We 
have  identified  the different  types of agreements  that are commonly used  in  IP networks, 
and  examined  the  different  models  used  in  supporting  the  agreements  in  each  of  those 
contexts.  Most  of  the  industry  currently  tends  to  follow  an  insurance  model  for 
supporting  service  level  agreements,  although  we  would  expect  them  to  move  towards 
the more dynamic schemes in the near future.
