Abstract   :This  research  paper  stud ies  the  use  o f  d istributed   da tabase management   systems  (DDBM Ss)  in  the  in forma t ion 
infrastructure  o f  modern   organiza t ions   to   reduce  the  uncerta int ies  occurring   in   organiza t ion .  The  key   purpose  o f  the  
research  is  to   determine  the  feasib i l i ty  and   appl icab i l ity  o f DDBMS s  for  today's  business  app l ica t ions. The  forces which  
drove  the  selection  o f  this  top ic  were  the  improvements  o f  d istributed   features  in  lead ing   da tabase  management   systems 
(DBMSs )  in   recent   years,   as  wel l   as  the  po tent ia l   o f  d istributed   da tabases  to   provide  compet it ive  advantages  for 
organiza t ions for proper ut i l iza t ion o f infrastructure to  ob ta in the meaning ful   informa t ion.

DDBMS s Cur rent ly Ava i lab le   

Several  years   ago   find ing   the  r igh t   too l  fo r  imp le men t ing

DDBMSs   availab le . Today   d istribu ted   featu res  are  common   in  
the  lates t  DBMS  o ffer ings   from  all  ma jo r  vendo rs .  In  fact ,  it   is 
rare  fo r  DBM Ss   with   d is tribu ted   featu res   to   be  referred   to   as 
" d is tribu ted"  databas es  at  all  -  the  featu re  is  s o  p revalen t  that   it 
does   not   d is t ingu is h   one  p roduct  from  ano ther.  The  ma jo r  
d iffe rences   between   p roducts  now  are  the  techn ical  details   o f 
how  the data d is tribu t ion   is  perfo rmed   and   the s pecial  featu res

The  DBMS  mar ket   is   fierce ly   compet it ive,  w ith   no   one 
p ro fes s ional  dominat ing   comp lete ly .  A cco rd ing   to   Dataques t 
figu res   repo rted   in   Compu ter  Resel ler  News,  the  1998  
databas e  licens e  revenue  leaders   were  IBM   with   32. 3%,  
Orac le  w ith   29. 4%,  M icros o ft   with   10 .2% ,  In fo rmix  w ith  
4. 4%,  and  Sybas e with  3. 5% . IBM 's  lead   is  due p rimar i ly  to  its  
dominance  in   the  ma in fra me   and   AS/400   p latfo rms ;   on   al l  
o ther  p latfo rms  Oracle  is   the  leader. Th is  s ect ion  firs t   p rov ides 
an   overv iew  o f  featu res  common   among   today 's   lead ing
