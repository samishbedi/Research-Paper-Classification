The  life  sciences  provide  a  rich  application 
domain for  data  management  research,  with  a  broad 
diversity  of  problems  that  can  make  a  signifcant 
difference  to progress  in  life  sciences  research.  This 
article  is  an  extract  from  the  Report  of  the  NSF 
Workshop  on  Data  Management  for  Molecular  and 
Cell  Biology,  edited  by  H.  V.  Jagadish  and  Frank 
Olken  The workshop was held at the National Library 
of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, Feb. 2-3,2003. 

The Crisis in Data Management for Biological 
Sciences 
Over  the  past  15  years  we  have  witnessed  a 
dramatic  transformation  in  the  practice  of  molecular 
biology.  What was  once a  cottage  industry marked  by 
scarce,  expensive  data  obtained  largely  by  the  manual 
efforts of  small  groups  of  graduate  students, post-docs, 
and  a  few  technicians  has  become 
industrialized 
(routinely and  robustly  high  throughput) and  data-rich, 
marked by  factory scale sequencing organizations (such 
as  the  Joint  Genome  Institute, Whitehead  Institute,  the 
Institute  for  Genomic  Research).  Such  sequencing 
factories  rely  on  extensive  automation  of  both 
sequencing  and  sample preparation.  Commencing with 
sequencing,  such  industrialization is  being  extended  to 
high throughput proteomics, metabolomics, etc. 
While this industrialization of biological research is 
partly  the  result  of  technological  improvements  in 
sequencing  instrumentation  and  automated  sample 
preparation  it  is  also  driven  by  massive  increases  in 
public  and  private  investment  and  dramatic  changes  in 
the  social  organization of  molecular  biology  (e.g.,  the 
creation of highly specialized, factory scale organizations 
for  mass  genomic  sequencing).  Such  industrialization 
and  the  accompanying growth  in molecular biology data 
availability demand similar scale up and specialization in 
the  data  management  systems  that  support  and  exploit 
this  data  gathering. 
To  date,  the  bioinformatics 
community has largely made do with custom handcrafted 
data management  software or with  conventional DBMS 
(database management system) technology developed for 
accounting applications. 
The industrialization of molecular biology has been 
largely  the  province  of  pharmacological,  government, 
and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  academic  molecular  biology 
research.  However,  it  is  clear  that  we  stand  at  the 
threshold  of  clinical  application  of  many  of  these 

technologies, e.g.,  as clinical laboratory tests for medical 
applications.  Such  clinical applications will  entail great 
increases  in  the  laboratory  and  data  management 
activities to handle tens or hundreds of millions of assays 
annually in  the U.S.  Similarly, the  approaches and data 
generation  output  from  ever  higher  levels  of  biological 
complexity will  be  increasingly data  intensive and  high 
throughput. 
Instruments,  data,  and  data  management  systems 
are complementary goods, i.e.,  their joint  consumption is 
much more useful than consuming a single commodity at 
a time.  It  is trivial to  see that data management systems 
are much more useful if they contain data.  Consider also 
what  how  limited  the  utility  of  genomic  sequence data 
would  be  if  we  could  only  publish  it  in  books,  and 
manually  compare 
it. 
The  availability  of  data 
management software that permits the rapid  searching of 
large genomic sequence databases for similar sequences 
greatly enhances the utility of such sequence data.  Quick 
sequence comparisons are  not  sufficient by  themselves; 
the  fact that many  (most)  of  these  sequences have been 
collected  into  a  few  databases  (e.g.,  GenBank)  greatly 
simplifies the comparison task. 
In  a  similar  vein,  we  note  that  many  instruments 
used  in  molecular  biology  and  chemistry  produce 
spectra,  or 
spectra-like 
results, 
e.g., 
infrared 
spectrographs, gas  andlor  liquid  chromatography,  mass 
spectrometers.  Such instruments must be  complemented 
with  large  community  databases  of  spectra,  and  data 
management  systems  that  can  store and quickly retrieve 
matching  spectra,  to  provide  greatest  value  to  biology, 
biochemistry, forensics, and medicine. 
We expect that this explosive growth in  the volume 
and  diversity  of  biological  and  biochemical  data  will 
continue  into  the  21"  century.  Success  in  the  life 
sciences  will  hinge  critically  on  the  availability  of 
computational  and  data  management  tools  to  analyze, 
interpret,  compare,  and manage  this  abundance of  data. 
Increasingly,  much  of  biology 
is  viewed  as  an 
information  science,  concerned  with  how  cells, 
organisms,  and  ecological  systems encode  and  process 
information  in  genetics,  cellular  control,  organism 
development, environmental response, and evolution. 
For  small  data  sets  that  are  analyzed  by  a  single 
user, 
it 
is  often  possible 
to  side-step  database 
management systems altogether. 
Indeed,  simple home- 
grown  programs,  and  Per1  scripts  in  particular,  have 

SIGMOD Record, Vol. 33, No.  2, June 2004 

adequately  served  the  needs  of  many  a  scientist. 
However, as the size of the data grows, the complexity of 
the  analysis  grows,  and  the  diversity  of  the  sources 
grows,  these  home-grown  solutions do  not  scale  easily. 
The  value  of  developing  cross-cutting  technology  for 
data management becomes more apparent. 

Requirements of Biological Data Management 
Database  management  systems  researchers  and 
vendors  have  often  advertised  that  their  products  have 
universal  applicability. 
In  fact,  data  management 
technology  development  has  been  shaped  by  different 
applications  over  the  past  30  years.  Commercial 
(banking,  payroll,  and  inventory) applications drove the 
development of relational DBMS, CAD (computer aided 
design)  applications  drove  the  development  of  object- 
oriented  databases,  management  information  systems 
have  driven  data  warehousing  and  OLAP  (Online 
Analytical Processing) data management technology, and 
web  content  and  e-commerce  technology  have  driven 
XML data management systems.  Biological applications 
have  their  own  requirements  that  will  require  further 
advances  in  data  management  technology.

terminology 

for 

These topics are discussed more  extensively in  the 
full  technical  report  [I].  Here  we  briefly  elaborate on 
only a few of these points. 

Diversity of Data Types and Queries 
A  striking  feature  of  biological  data  is  the  great 
diversity of data types: sequences, graphs, 3D structures, 
scalar  and  vector  field  data,  etc.  The  queries  posed 
against  these  data  types  are  also  diverse,  and  different 
from 
common 
commercial 
queries.  Whereas 
conventional  databases  are  dominated  by  exact  match 
(equality)  and  range  (inequality)  queries,  biological 
applications  involve  the  pervasive  use  of  similarity 

queries, e.g.,  classic sequence similarity queries, but also 
including  subgraph  isomorphism, 
pattern  matching 
queries  (e.g., 
regular  expressions,  Hidden  ~ a r k o i  
models) and pattern identification queries. 
Sequences: The availability of sequence data, e.g., 
DNA,  RNA,  and  amino-acid  sequences  (proteins),  has 
grown  explosively  over  the  past  decade  with  the 
development  of  automated  sequencing  machines  and 
large  scale  sequencing projects  such  as  the  human  and 
mouse  genome  sequencing  projects.  Sequences  are 
presently  often  stored  as 
text  strings,  but 
this 
representation  is  awkward  when  we  want  to  annotate 
sequences, since text strings typically lack addressability 
at  the  level  of  individual  letters  (nucleotides, or  amino 
acids).  Often  DNA  sequences  include  not  only 
individual  nucleotides,  but  also  gaps,  usually  with  a 
length (or bounds on length) specification of the gap. 
Graphs: Many  types of graphs occur in  biological 
data, including a directed (or undirected) labeled graph, a 
nested  graph,  and  a  hyper-graph.  Examples  include 
various  biopathways  (metabolic  pathways,  signaling 
pathways,  and  gene  regulatory networks),  genetic maps 
(partial  order  graphs  (i.e.,  directed  acyclic  graphs), 
taxonomies  (either  trees  or  DAGs),  chemical  structure 
graphs,  contact  graphs  (for  3D  protein  structure),  etc. 
Graphs  are  easily  stored  in  existing  DBMSs,  e.g., 
relational DBMSs.  However, many graph  queries, e.g., 
subgraph  isomorphism,  subgraph  homomorphism,  and 
subgraph homeomorphism are difficult (or impossible) to 
pose  and  answer  efficiently  in  existing  relational 
DBMSs, which know nothing of graphs. 
High-Dimensional  Data:  It  is  not  unusual  for 
micro-array  experiments  of  gene  expression  to  involve 
thousands (or  tens of  thousands) of genes and  hundreds 
(or  thousands)  of  experimental conditions and  samples. 
Generated datasets are arrays of spot intensities over the 
Cartesian  product  of  genes  and  samples 
(e.g., 
experimental  conditions).  Often 
researchers  are 
interested  identifying  clusters  of  genes  which  exhibit 
similar  (or  opposite)  patterns  of  gene  regulation. 
Specialized data structures and clustering algorithms are 
needed to support nearest neighbor, range searching, and 
clustering queries in high-dimensional spaces. 
Shapes:  Three-dimensional  molecular  (protein, 
ligand, complex)  structure data  is  another common  data 
type.  Such data  includes both  shape  information  (e.g., 
ball  and  stick models for protein backbones) and  (more 
generally)  scalar  and  vector  field  data  of  charge, 
hydrophobicity, and  other  chemical  properties  specified 
as functions over the  volume  (or surface) of  a molecule 
or complex. 
Temporal Data: Temporal data must frequently be 
managed  when  studying  the  dynamics  of  biological 
systems. 
Examples  include  cellular  response 
to 
environmental changes, pathway regulation, dynamics of 

SIGMOD Record, Vol. 3 3 ,  No.  2, J u n e  2004 

gene  expression  levels,  protein  structure  dynamics, 
developmental biology, and evolutionary biology. 
Temporal data  in  biological  settings can  either be 
absolute or relative.  Absolute time-stamping  is common 
in  administrative or  long  term  ecological  observational 
databases  --  time  is  recorded  relative  to  an  absolute 
global  temporal  coordinates  such  as  UTC  date-time. 
Relative  time-stamping  records  time  relative  to  some 
event --  e.g.,  cell division,  organism birth,  oncogenesis, 
diagnosis,  cold  shock,  etc.  Most  implementations  of 
time  in  the  database  cornmunitv  have  focused  on 
absolute  time,  whereas  relative  time  is  much  more 
commonly  used  in  most  biological  experiments. 
In 
complex settings such as disease progression,  there may 
be  multiple  important  events  against  which  time  is 
reckoned: 
Scalar and Vector Fields:  Scalar and  vector  field 
data  is  normally  thought  of  primarily  in  the  context  of 
spatio-temporal applications such as computational fluid 
dynamics,  weather, 
climate,  oceanography  and 
combustion  modeling.  However,  a  number  of 
participants  of  the  workshop  argued  that  such  data  is 
quite 
important  for  molecular  and  cell  biology 
applications.  Examples  include modeling  reactant  and 
charge distribution across the  volume  of  a  cell,  calcium 
fluxes across the cell  surface or cell volume, reactant or 
protein  fluxes  across  cell  membranes,  transport  across 
cellular  compartments,  clinical  response  to  drugs. 
the  visualization,  computational  fluid 
Efforts

and  geographic 
information 
systems 
communities to  deal  with  vector  and  scalar  field  data 
have  focused  on  the  development  of  fiber  bundle  or 
vector bundle data models. 
Mathematical Models: Much of modern biological 
data  analysis  is  concerned  with  the  specification, 
development,  parameter 
estimation,  and 
testing 
(statistical  or  simulation)  of  various  mathematical  and 
statistical  models  of  biological  systems  and  datasets. 
Thus  far  the  database  community  has  largely  been 
concerned  with  storing  and  querying  input  data  sets, 
estimated  parameters  sets,  and  simulation  output 
datasets.  Relatively  little  attention  has  been  paid  to 
systematic  methods  of  representing,  storing,  and 
querying  the  mathematical  and  statistical models  being 
used.  One would like to have declarative specification of 
mathematical  and  statistical models,  means of  recording 
bindings  of  model  variables  to  database  contents,  and 
some way  of recording the statistical analysis method (or 
simulation method) used. 
Constraints:  Historically,  DBMSs  have  provided 
mechanisms  to  specify  and  enforce  a  variety  of  logical 
constraints on  the  contents  or  allowable updates  of  the 
database, 
e.g., 
referential 
integrity 
constraints. 
Biological  databases  require  a  variety  of  constraint 
specifications,  both  logical  rules,  and  mathematical 
constraints (e.g.,  equations or  inequalities) as  first  class 
data types in a biological  data management system, with 

SIGMOD Record, Vol. 33, No.  2, J u n e  2004 

the  ability to  store, enforce, and  query  such  constraints. 
In  particular,  traditional  DBMSs  typically  have  no 
mechanism to enforce non-local constraints. 
Examples  of  mathematical  constraints  include 
various  conservation  constraints  such  as  mass, 
momentum  and  energy  conservation.  Thus  individual 
chemical  reactions  in  a  bio-pathway  database  must 
satisfy mass balance for each element.  Such constraints 
In  contrast,  cycles  of  reactions 
are

local. 
thermodynamic 
database  must 
satisfy 
energy 
conservation constraints.  These  are  non-local  (global) 
constraints.  Another  example  of  non-local  constraints 
are  the  prohibition of  cycles  in  overlap graphs of  DNA 
sequence  reads  for  linear  chromosomes,  or  in  the 
directed graphs of conceptual or biological taxonomies 
Patterns: On the many data types described above, 
one would  naturally expect similarity queries.  These are 
clearly important.  In addition, much effort has gone into 
specifying,  characterizing,  and  finding  patterns  (a.k.a. 
motifs),  e.g.  in  DNA,  RNA,  and  protein  sequences. 
These  patterns  are  often  represented  as  regular 
expressions or Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or other 
types  of  grammars.  Biologists  are  interested  in 
collecting, storing, and querying these patterns.  Patterns 
thus need  to be  considered as first class data types, with 
support for storage and querying. 
A  second  class  of  queries  consists  of  pattern 
matching  queries,  i.e.,  queries  which  find  instances  of 
sequences,  etc.  which  match  a  specific  pattern.  On 
strings these  queries  involve pattern  specifications such 
as regular expressions, Hidden Markov Models,  or chart 
grammars.  Graph pattern queries might  involve patterns 
specified by  graph  grammars,  subgraph homomorphism 
queries, etc. 
One will  also want  to be  able  query  collections of 
patterns (motifs).  One such query would involve finding 
all  patterns which match  a  sequence (the  inverse of  the 
customary  query).  Alternatively,  one  might  ask  for 
patterns which are similar to a specified pattern.  Pattern 
similarity might  be  defined  either  structurally  (akin  to 
sequence  similarity)  or  in  terms  of  the  overlap  in  the 
sequences matched by  the  two patterns from a  specified 
database. 

This diversity of  data  and  query  types has  two 
implications for data management  technology.  First,  we 
need 
to  develop  specialized  indexing  and  query 
processing techniques to deal with these specialized data 
and  query  types.  Second,  we  need  to  develop  more 
extensible data  management  systems.  Current  DBMSs 
have  object-relational 
facilities 
that  offer  some 
extensibility features, which  have been  used  to  support 
geographic  information  systems and  chemo-informatics 
systems. Most of the workshop  participants believe that 
limited  and 
too 
current  extension  facilities  are 

cumbersome to fully cope with the diversity of biological 
data and queries. 

Data Provenance 
Questions  of  data  release  policies  for  biological 
data are properly questions of public policy, not technical 
discussion.  However,  it has  become  increasingly clear 
that  good  data management  infrastructure for  recording 
and  querying  data  provenance  -  the  origin  and 
processing  history  of  data  - is  vital  if  we  are  to 
effectively  encourage  the  sharing  of  biological  and 
biomedical  data.  Data  provenance  issues  have  been 
largely  neglected  by  the  database  research  community 
except  for  a  few  researchers  in  statistical  data 
management  and  data  warehousing.  This  area  clearly 
needs  further  work  to  support  bioinformatics  data 
sharing.  The  topic  is  also  of  increasing interest  to  the 
regulatory  community  (e.g., 
the  Food  and  Drug 
Administration). 
The  classic  approach to  sharing knowledge  in  the 
biology community has been  to publish journal  articles. 
Authors receive public  acclaim and acknowledgement in 
exchange for publication of their knowledge.  Individual 
articles and  authors are  acknowledged via  bibliographic 
citations (or sometimes co-authorship), and systems have 
been  developed to  record the number of citations papers 
received.  We  believe  that  similar  mechanisms  are 
needed  to  acknowledge  "publication"  of  datasets  in 
shared  databases,  so  as  to  encourage  rapid,  effective 
sharing  of  data.  Data  management  support  for  tracking 
data  provenance  (origins)  can  provide  the  analog  of 
citations.  Usage  tracking  software  can  potentially 
provide analogs to bibliographic citation counts.  Support 
for automatic tracking and  querying of data  provenance 
is fairly undeveloped in current DBMSs. 
There are other important motivations for recording 
and querying data provenance.  Knowledge of the source 
and  processing  history  of  data  items  permits  users  to 
place  the  data  in  context  and  helps  to  assess  its 
reliability.  Data  provenance  histories  also  facilitate 
revision of  derived data when  the  base  data  (or  analysis 
codes) change.  DBMS support is needed to facilitate the 
automated  update  of  provenance  information  as  the 
database  is  updated  and  the  automatic  propagation  of 
provenance information wit query results.  Experience in 
other  settings,  e.g.,  geographic  information  systems, 
indicates that  unless metadata  (e.g.,  data provenance)  is 
automatically  updated,  it  is  likely  to  quickly  become 
outdated. 

Uncertainty 
Biological  data  has  a  great  deal  of  inherent 
uncertainty.  Often, when  a scientist says "A  is a B  they 
mean "A  is probably a B, because there is some (possibly 
substantial) evidence  suggesting that  such  is  the  case". 
For  example:  A  protein  sequence may  be  erroneously 
recorded  in GenBank, because  only a partial protein was 

reported; this error  is propagated when  another scientist 
runs  a  Blast  search  against  sequences  in  GenBank  and 
reports matches against such an erroneous sequence. 
For all of these reasons, it is important to recognize 
uncertainty (and possible  inconsistency) of data recorded 
in  biological  databases.  Standard  database  technology 
provides  no  support  for  uncertainty,  since  business- 
oriented commercial databases typically contain data that 
is  certain. 
investigators  often  resolve 
Individual 
uncertainties  and  inconsistencies by  manual  inspection 
and  editing  of  datasets  - a  process  known  as  manual 
curation. 
In  large  scale  database  setting,  explicit 
representation  of  uncertainty  and  automated  tools  for 
curation  are  needed.  Difficulties  in  scaling  up  curation 
activities have  been  the bane  of major public biological 
databases. 

Workflow Management 
Large  scale  molecular  biology  experiments  and 
data  analyses  need  workflow  management  systems  to 
assist in  orchestrating the work  and recording the  details 
of what was  done  to  each  sample andlor dataset.  Both 
laboratory  WFMS  (known  as  LIMS  -  laboratory 
information  management  systems)  and  computational 
workflow  management  systems  (sometimes  called 
scientific workflow  management)  are  needed  for  large 
projects.  Explicit  representation  and  recording  of 
laboratory  and  computational  protocols  is  useful  in 
driving automated data analyses and subsequent retrieval 
of  experiments  on  the  basis  of  protocol  features. 
Detailed  records  on  experiments  are  useful  for  process 
yield analyses and  process  failure diagnosis.  Biological 
workflows  differ  from  conventional workflows  in  that 
pooling and splitting of samples is commonplace. 

Data Integration 
Many,  if  not  most,  applications  of  biological  and 
biomedical  databases require  the  ability  to  access  data 
from many different databases (and datasets).  There has 
been  a  veritable  explosion  in  specialized  biological 
databases.  Many  researchers  regard  these  specialized 
databases as extremely valuable, in part  due  to the  very 
detailed and carefil curation of the  data by  specialists in 
particular domains.  However,  no  matter how  good  the 
data management technology for data  integration, we  do 
not  foresee that it will be practical for data integration to 
succeed  in  a world  of  hundreds  of  biological databases 
unless 
the  database  providers  provide  extensive 
assistance  in  the  form  of  publicly  accessible,  machine 
processable  documentation  concerning  the  database 
schemas,  contents,  query  interfaces,  query  languages, 
etc.  Adoption  of  such  current  technology by  database 
providers was seen as a pressing issue. 
The  current  practice  of  only  providing  access  to 
most  specialized  biological  databases  via  web-based 
forms is not  sufficient: query APIs  and  query languages 
are needed to facilitate data integration.  The provision 

SIGMOD Record, Vol. 33, No.  2, J u n e  2004 

of  suitable data documentation and adoption of standard 
data  exchange  formats  and  query  languages  and  APIs 
will  have  to  be  seen  as  a  social  obligation  of 
investigators 
similar 
to 
careful  description  of 
experimental methods  in  publication.  The  efforts  of  the 
Micro-array Gene  Expression Data  Society, to  develop 
standard  schemas  for  micro-array  data,  represent  an 
instance where  significant steps have  been  taken  in  this 
direction. 
We  note  that  the  structural biology  and  genomics 
communities  have  also  resorted  to  various  social 
sanctions to encourage data sharing, e.g., requirements of 
depositing data  in  PDB  or GenBank prior  to  acceptance 
of  papers  for  publication,  and  requirements  for  data 
deposition as a condition of grant renewal and a criterion 
for  funding  of  new  grants.  We  anticipate  that  similar 
activism  by  federal  research  program  managers  and 
journal  editors will  continue to be required, both  for data 
deposition  and  to  assure  adoption  of  best  practices  to 
facilitate data  sharing, such as complete documentation, 
data  exchange  encoding,  and  support  for  query  APIs 
(e.g.,  Web  Services  Description  Language)  and  query 
languages (SQL, OQL, XQuery, et al.) 
In  addition  to  the  short-term  needs  of  machine- 
readable descriptions, and the constructions of wrappers, 
there are deeper questions to be  addressed with regard to 
model  management.  Mapping  between  different  data 
models  or data representations is an integral part of any 
biological  database  application.  For  example,  there  is 
often  external  information  or archival data  that must  be 
imported 
to  augment 
local  computationally  or 
experimentally  derived  data.  Even  within  a  single 
project,  there  can  be  the  need  for  multiple  models  or 
representations  for  the  same  kind  of  information,  as  it 
moves  through  various  stages,  e.g.,  data  entry,  data 
query,  data  interchange,  and  data  archiving.  With 
Affymetrix gene expression data, for example, data entry 
may  be  what Affyrnetrix produces,  data query may  be  a 
relational  database  with  some 
local  model,  data 
interchange  may  use  MAGE-ML,  and  data  archive  is 
what some consortium requires. 
Data  sources evolve as knowledge  changes and  as 
new  experimental  techniques  produce  more  data  and 
different characterizations of the  data.  As  a result,  both 
the schemas that describe the data as well as applications 
and  queries written specific to the original version of the 
schema must be updated.  This is difficult to accomplish, 
particularly  when  the  data  types  and  structures  are 
complex  and  when  the  analysis  involves  complex 
transformations  or  aggregations.  Keeping  up  with 
evolution becomes  significantly more  difficult if  there  is 
a  fundamental  change  in  our  understanding  of  the 
meaning or the characterization of the data. 

Interdisciplinary Research 
the  rise  of 
The  past  decade  has  seen 
bioinformaticists (a.k.a.  bioinformaticians), a new group 

SIGMOD Record, Vol. 33, No.  2, June 2004 

of researchers operating across the disciplines of biology, 
statistics,  computer  science,  and  mathematics.  Their 
interdisciplinary  activities  now  have 
their  own 
professional society, conferences, and journals. 
Orchestrating  fruitful  interdisciplinary  research 
across biology,  bioinformatics,  and  data management is 
not  easy.  Even within  the  workshop, there was  heated 
debate about  the  best  strategy to  accomplish this.  Lack 
of 
sufficient 
interaction 
among 
biologists, 
bioinformaticists, and  data management  researchers  can 
easily  lead  to  attempts  to  reinvent  well-known  data 
management technologies by bioinformaticists, or  sterile 
pursuits  of  insignificant or  misunderstood problems  by 
data management  researchers.  Also,  the  time  scales  of 
data  management  research  and  development  are  often 
incompatible  with 
the  production  requirements  of 
ongoing  biological  laboratories  or  public  databases. 
Despite early plans  and efforts (e.g.,  by DOE)  the major 
human  genome  sequencing  centers  have  generally  not 
been  major  sources  of  innovative  data  management 
technology.  The  most  intellectually  fruitful  endeavors 
have  often  come  from  data  management  or  computer 
science research  groups with  looser  collaborations with 
biologists.  The  time  required  to  develop new  database 
technologies  often  exceeds  the  time  demands  of  most 
biologists  or  bioinformaticists,  who  must  produce 
biologically relevant data to sustain funding. 

Recommendations 
A  sustained program  supported  across the  federal 
agencies  at  the  frontier  between  biology  and  data 
management  technology  will  allow  us  to  share  the 
database  expertise  of  the  IT  (information  technology) 
professionals  with  bioinformaticists  and  biological 
experimentalists supported  across  the  federal  agencies. 
There  are  needs  for  both 
research 
in  database 
management  technologies  and  innovative application of 
existing  database  technology  to  biological  problems. 
Funding  agencies  will  have  to  set  up  appropriately 
staffed  review  panels  charged  with  suitable  review 
criteria for supporting such interdisciplinary work. 
It is also valuable to define challenge problems that 
push  the  boundaries  of  data  management  technology, 
which,  if  successful, would  enable  major  advances  in 
biomedical  science.  Well-specified  challenges  can  help 
direct  data  management  researchers  toward  important 
bioinformatics problems.  Creation  of  test  data  sets and 
benchmarks  are  also  worthy  endeavors  in  themselves, 
and  should  be  supported  as  appropriate  and  possible. 
Much  of  this work must be  done by  life scientists.  The 
availability of  such test data  sets and  query benchmarks 
facilitates  the  comparison  of  new  approaches  to  older 
ones. 
We  expect,  in  the  foreseeable  future,  that  it  will 
become  important  to  have  physicians  and  experimental 
biologists  trained  in  computational  methods,  just  as 
training  in  genetics  has  now  become  routine  for

physicians.  Biology  is  often  an  exercise  in  induction 
(generalization from many  instances), whereas computer 
science  is  more  often  a  deductive  enterprise,  because 
computer  algorithrns/systems are  usually  designed,  not 
evolved, artifacts.  Solution to  a  specific biological  data 
management  problem  is  of  less  interest  to  a  computer 
scientist than the generalization of this problem to a class 
of  data  management  problems,  all  of  which  can  be 
solved  in  one  fell  swoop  through  an  appropriate 
computational  advance.  And  rightly  so,  since  this 
paradigm  is  significantly  more  cost-effective  in  the 
domains  to  which  it  is  applicable.  We  note  that 
experimental  design  and  algorithmic  design  are  often 
similar endeavors. 

Conclusions 
The  development  of  high  throughput methods 
and  the  establishment of  commercial  sources  for  even 
highly  specialized biochemical  reagents  for  research  in 
molecular and cell biology over the past fifteen years has 
brought  a  huge  increase  in  the  volume  and  diversity of 
biological  and  biomedical  data.  Clinical  use  of  these 
technologies  has  already  begun  and  extensive,  even 
routine,  application  is

exploitation  of  these  expensive  investments  in  data 
collection  will  require  complementary  investments  in 
data management technology. 
To date most efforts to manage this data have relied 
either on commercial off-the-shelf DBMSs developed for 
business data, or on homegrown systems that are neither 
flexible  nor  scalable. 
Better  data  management 
technology  is needed  to effectively address specific data 
management  needs  of  the  life  sciences.  Such  needs 
include  support  for  diverse  data  types  (such  as 
sequences, graphs,  3D structures, etc.) and  queries (e.g., 
similarity based retrieval), data provenance tracking,  and 
integration of numerous autonomous databases.
