Secure and Efficient Data Transmission
for Cluster-Based Wireless Sensor Networks

Huang Lu, Student Member, IEEE, J ie L i, Sen ior Member, IEEE, and Mohsen Gu izan i, Fe l low, IEEE

Abstract—Secure data transmission is a critical issue for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Clustering is an effective and practical way
to enhance the system performance of WSNs. In this paper, we study a secure data transmission for cluster-based WSNs (CWSNs),
where the clusters are formed dynamically and periodically. We propose two secure and efficient data transmission (SET) protocols for
CWSNs, called SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS, by using the identity-based digital signature (IBS) scheme and the identity-based online/
offline digital signature (IBOOS) scheme, respectively. In SET-IBS, security relies on the hardness of the Diffie-Hellman problem in the
pairing domain. SET-IBOOS further reduces the computational overhead for protocol security, which is crucial for WSNs, while its
security relies on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. We show the feasibility of the SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS protocols with
respect to the security requirements and security analysis against various attacks. The calculations and simulations are provided to
illustrate the efficiency of the proposed protocols. The results show that the proposed protocols have better performance than the
existing secure protocols for CWSNs, in terms of security overhead and energy consumption.

1 INTRODUCTION
A WIRELESS sensor network (WSN) is a network system
comprised of spatially distributed devices using
wireless sensor nodes to monitor physical or environmental
conditions, such as sound, temperature, and motion. The
individual nodes are capable of sensing their environments,
processing the information data locally, and sending data to
one or more collection points in a WSN [1]. Efficient data
transmission is one of the most important issues for WSNs.
Meanwhile, many WSNs are deployed in harsh, neglected,
and often adversarial physical environments for certain
applications, such as military domains and sensing tasks
with trustless surroundings [2]. Secure and efficient data
transmission (SET) is, thus, especially necessary and is
demanded in many such practical WSNs.

1.1 Background and Motivations
Cluster-based data transmission in WSNs has been inves-
tigated by researchers to achieve the network scalability and
management, which maximizes node lifetime and reduce
bandwidth consumption by using local collaboration
among sensor nodes [3]. In a cluster-based WSN (CWSN),
every cluster has a leader sensor node, regarded as cluster-
head (CH). A CH aggregates the data collected by the leaf
nodes (non-CH sensor nodes) in its cluster, and sends the

aggregation to the base station (BS). The low-energy
adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol presented
by Heinzelman et al. [4] is a widely known and effective one
to reduce and balance the total energy consumption for
CWSNs. To prevent quick energy consumption of the set of
CHs, LEACH randomly rotates CHs among all sensor
nodes in the network ,
in rounds . LEACH ach ieves
improvements in terms of network lifetime. Following the
idea of LEACH, a number of protocols have been presented
such as APTEEN [5] and PEACH [6], which use similar
concepts of LEACH. In this paper, for convenience, we call
this sort of cluster-based protocols as LEACH-like proto-
cols. Researchers have been widely studying CWSNs in the
last decade in the literature. However, the implementation
of the cluster-based architecture in the real world is rather
complicated [7].
Adding security to LEACH-like protocols is challenging
because they dynamically, randomly, and periodically
rearrange the network ’s c lusters and da ta l inks [8] .
Therefore, providing steady long-lasting node-to-node trust
relationships and common key distributions are inadequate
for LEACH-like protocols (most existing solutions are
provided for distributed WSNs, but not for CWSNs). There
are some secure data transmission protocols based on
LEACH-like protocols, such as SecLEACH [8], GS-LEACH
[9], and RLEACH [10]. Most of them, however, apply the
symmetric key management for security, which suffers from
a so-called orphan node problem [11]. This problem occurs
when a node does not share a pairwise key with others in its
preloaded key ring. To mitigate the storage cost of symmetric
keys, the key ring in a node is not sufficient for it to share
pairwise symmetric keys with all of the nodes in a network.
In such a case, it cannot participate in any cluster, and
therefore, has to elect itself as a CH. Furthermore, the orphan
node problem reduces the possibility of a node joining with a
CH, when the number of alive nodes owning pairwise keys

decreases after a long-term operation of the network. Since
the more CHs elected by themselves, the more overall energy
consumed of the network [4], the orphan node problem
increases the overhead of transmission and system energy
consumption by raising the number of CHs. Even in the case
that a sensor node does share a pairwise key with a distant
CH but not a nearby CH, it requires comparatively high
energy to transmit data to the distant CH.
The feasibility of the asymmetric key management has
been shown in WSNs recently, which compensates the
shortage from applying the symmetric key management for
security [12]. Digital signature is one of the most critical
security services offered by cryptography in asymmetric
key management systems, where the binding between the
public key and the identification of the signer is obtained
via a digital certificate [13]. The identity-based digital
signature (IBS) scheme [14], based on the difficulty of
factoring integers from identity-based cryptography (IBC),
is to derive an entity’s public key from its identity
information, for example, from its name or ID number.
Recently, the concept of IBS has been developed as a key
management
in WSNs for security. Carman [15]
first
combined the benefits of IBS and key predistribution set
into WSNs, and some papers appeared in recent years [16],
[17], [18]. The IBOOS scheme has been proposed to reduce
the computation and storage costs of signature processing.
A general method for constructing online/offline signature
schemes was introduced by Even et al. [19]. The IBOOS
scheme could be effective for the key management in
WSNs. Specifically, the offline phase can be executed on a
sensor node or at the BS prior to communication, while the
online phase is to be executed during communication. Some
IBOOS schemes are designed for WSNs afterwards, such as
[20] and [21]. The offline signature in these schemes,
however,
is precomputed by a third party and lacks
reusability, thus they are not suitable for CWSNs.

1.2 Contributions and Organization
Recently, we have applied and evaluated the key manage-
ment of IBS to routing in CWSNs [17]. In this paper, we
extend our previous work and focus on providing an
efficient secure data communication for CWSNs. The
contributions of this work are as follows:

. W e p r o p o s e tw o Se c u r e a n d E f f i c i e n t d a t a
T ransmission protocols for CWSNs, called SET-IBS
and SET-IBOOS, by using the IBS scheme and the
IBOOS scheme, respectively. The key idea of both
SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS is to authenticate the
encrypted sensed data, by applying digital signatures
to message packets, which are efficient in commu-
nication and applying the key management for
security. In the proposed protocols, secret keys and
pairing parameters are distributed and preloaded in
all sensor nodes by the BS initially, which overcomes
the key escrow problem described in ID-based
cryptosystems [22].
Secure communication in SET-IBS relies on the ID-
based cryptography,
in which, user public keys
are their ID information. Thus, users can obtain the
corresponding private keys without auxiliary data

.

transmission, which is efficient in communication
and saves energy.
SET-IBOOS is proposed to further reduce the compu-
tational overhead for security using the IBOOS
scheme, in which security relies on the hardness of
the discrete logarithmic problem. Both SET-IBS and
SET-IBOOS solve the orphan node problem in the
secure data transmission with a symmetric key
management.
. We show the feasibility of the proposed protocols
with respect
to the security requirements and
analysis against three attack models. Moreover, we
compare the proposed protocols with the existing
secure protocols for efficiency by calculations and
simulations, respectively, with respect
to both
computation and communication.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 describes the network architecture, security
vulnerabilities, and objectives. Section 3 introduces the IBS
and IBOOS schemes for CWSNs. Sections 4 and 5 present
the details of
the proposed SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS,
respectively, and Section 6 presents the protocol features
and characteristics. Section 7 analyzes and evaluates the
proposed SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS. The last section con-
cludes this work.

2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND PROTOCOL
OBJECTIVES

This section presents the network architecture, security
vulnerabilities, and protocol objectives.

2.1 Network Architecture
Consider a CWSN consisting of a fixed BS and a large
number of wireless sensor nodes, which are homogeneous
in functionalities and capabilities. We assume that the BS is
always reliable, i.e., the BS is a trusted authority (TA).
Meanwhile, the sensor nodes may be compromised by
attackers, and the data transmission may be interrupted
from attacks on wireless channel. In a CWSN, sensor nodes
are grouped into clusters, and each cluster has a CH sensor
node, which is elected autonomously. Leaf (non-CH) sensor
nodes join a cluster depending on the receiving signal
strength and transmit the sensed data to the BS via CHs to
save energy. The CHs perform data fusion, and transmit
data to the BS directly with comparatively high energy. In
addition, we assume that all sensor nodes and the BS are
time synchronized with symmetric radio channels, nodes
are distributed randomly, and their energy is constrained.
In CWSNs, data sensing, processing, and transmission
consume energy of sensor nodes . The cost of data
transmission is much more expensive than that of data
processing. Thus, the method that the intermediate node
(e.g., a CH) aggregates data and sends it to the BS is
preferred than the method that each sensor node directly
sends data to the BS [1], [3]. A sensor node switches into
sleep mode for energy saving when it does not sense or
transmit data, depending on the time-division multiple
access (TDMA) control used for data transmission. In this
paper, the proposed SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS are both
designed for the same scenarios of CWSNs above.

2.2 Security Vulnerabilities and Protocol Objectives
The data transmission protocols for WSNs,
including
cluster-based protocols (LEACH-like protocols), are vulner-
able to a number of security attacks [2], [23]. Especially,
attacks to CHs in CWSNs could result in serious damage to
the network because data transmission and data aggrega-
tion depend on the CHs fundamentally. If an attacker
manages to compromise or pretend to be a CH, it can
provoke attacks such as sinkhole and selective forwarding
attacks, hence disrupting the network. On the other hand,
an attacker may intend to inject bogus sensing data into the
WSN, for example, pretend as a leaf node sending bogus
information toward the CHs. Nevertheless, LEACH-like
protocols are more robust against insider attacks than other
types of protocols in WSNs [23]. It is because CHs are
rotating from nodes to nodes in the network by rounds,
which makes it harder for intruders to identify the routing
elements as the intermediary nodes and attack them. The
characteristics of LEACH-like protocols reduce the risks of
being attacked on intermediary nodes, and make it harder
for an adversary to identify and compromise important
nodes (i.e., CH nodes).
The goal of the proposed secure data transmission for
CWSNs is to guarantee the secure and efficient data
transmissions between leaf nodes and CHs, as well as
transmission between CHs and the BS. Meanwhile, most of
existing secure transmission protocols for CWSNs in the
literature [8], [9], [10], however, apply the symmetric key
management for security, which suffers from the orphan
node problem that is introduced in Section 1. In this paper,
we aim to solve this orphan node problem by using the ID-
based cryptosystem that guarantees security requirements,
and propose SET-IBS by using the IBS scheme. Furthermore,
SET-IBOOS is proposed to reduce the computational over-
head in SET-IBS with the IBOOS scheme.

3 IBS AND IBOOS FOR CWSNS

In this section, we introduce the IBS scheme and IBOOS
scheme used in the paper. Note that the conventional
schemes are not specifically designed for CWSNs. We adapt
the conventional IBS scheme for CWSNs by distributing
functions to different kinds of sensor nodes, based on [24] at
first. To further reduce the computational overhead in the
signing and verification process of the IBS scheme, we adapt
the conventional IBOOS scheme for CWSNs, based on [21].
In a finite cyclic group GG of prime order q, there exists an
element g as the generator and elements gx 2 GG, such that
GG ¼ hgi ¼ fgx j x 2 ZZ
q ¼ f1; 2; . . . ; q   1gg, where ZZ
q is a
multiplicative group consisting of q   1 integers, in which the
multiplication operation in the group ends in the remainder
on the division by q (mod q) [25]. The discrete logarithm
problem (DLP) [26] in the cyclic group GG is to compute x, in
which the computational complexity is believed to be hard,
where the security in the IBOOS scheme is based on the DLP
in this work.

3.1 Pairing for IBS
For self-contained, we briefly review the characteristics of
pairing. Boneh and Franklin [22]
introduced the first
functional and efficient ID-based encryption scheme based
on bilinear pairings on elliptic curves . Specifically ,

randomly select two large primes p and q, and let E=Fp
indicate an elliptic curve y2 ¼ x3 þ ax þ b (4a3 þ 27b2 6¼ 0)
over a finite field Fp . We denote by GG1 a q-order
subgroup of the additive group of points in E=Fp , and
GG2 a q-order subgroup of the multiplicative group in the
p . The pairing is a mapping e : GG1  GG1 !
finite field F
GG2 , which is a bilinear map with the following properties:
1. B i l inear . 8 P ; Q; R; S 2 GG1 , eðP þ Q; R þ S Þ ¼ eðP ;
RÞeðP ; SÞeðQ; RÞeðQ; S Þ. In the same way, 8 c; d 2
q ; eðcP ; dQÞ ¼ eðP ; dQÞc ¼ eðcP ; QÞd ¼ eðP ; QÞcd , etc.
ZZ
2. Nondegeneracy. If P is a generator of GG1 , then eðP ; P Þ
is a generator of GG2 .
3. Computability. There is an efficient algorithm to
compute eðP ; QÞ in GG2 , 8 P ; Q 2 GG1 .
The security in the IBS scheme is based on the bilinear
Diffie-Hellman Problem (DHP) in the pairing domain [13],
and the hardness of DHP is defined in [22]. A bilinear map e
is secure if, given g; G; H 2 GG1 , it is hard to find h 2 GG1
such that eðh; H Þ ¼ eðg; GÞ [27]. Weil pairing [22] and Tate
pairing [28] are the examples of such bilinear mapping,
which present comprehensive descriptions of how pairing
parameters can be selected for security.

3.2 IBS Scheme for CWSNs
An IBS scheme implemented for CWSNs consists of the
following operations, specifically, setup at
the BS, key
extraction and signature signing at the data sending nodes,
and verification at the data receiving nodes:

.

.

.

Setup. The BS (as a trust authority) generates a
master key msk and public parameters param for the
private key generator (PKG), and gives them to all
sensor nodes.
Extraction. Given an ID string, a sensor node
generates a private key sekID associated with the
ID using msk.
Signature signing. Given a message M , time stamp t
and a signing key , the sending node generates a
signature SIG.
. Verification. Given the ID, M , and SIG, the receiving
node outputs “accept” if SIG is valid, and outputs
“reject” otherwise.
The detailed description of the original IBS scheme in
[24] is given in Appendix A.1

3.3 IBOOS Scheme for CWSNs
An IBOOS scheme implemented for CWSNs consists of
following four operations, specifically, setup at the BS, key
extraction and offline signing at the CHs, online signing at the
data sending nodes, and verification at the receiving nodes:

.
Setup. Same as that in the IBS scheme.
.
Extraction. Same as that in the IBS scheme.
. Offline signing. Given public parameters and time
stamp t, the CH sensor node generates an offline
signature SIGoffline , and transmit it to the leaf nodes
in its cluster.

4 THE PROPOSED SET-IBS PROTOCOL

In this paper, we propose two novel SET protocols for
CWSNs, called SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS, by using the IBS
scheme and the IBOOS scheme, respectively. We first
present SET-IBS in this section.
The proposed SET-IBS has a protocol initialization prior
to the network deployment and operates in rounds during
communication, which consists of a setup phase and a
steady-state phase in each round. We introduce the
protocol
initialization, describe the key management of
the protocol by using the IBS scheme, and the protocol
operations afterwards.

4.1 Protocol Initialization
In SET-IBS, time is divided into successive time intervals as
other LEACH-like protocols. We denote time stamps by Ts
for BS-to-node communication and by tj for leaf-to-CH
communication. Note that key predistribution is an efficient
method to improve communication security, which has
been adapted in WSNs in the literature [8], [9], [10], [15],
[16], [17], [18]. In this paper, we adopt IDkt as user’s public
key under an IBS scheme [24], and propose a novel secure
data transmission protocol by using IBS specifically for
CWSNs (SET-IBS). The corresponding private pairing
parameters are preloaded in the sensor nodes during the
protocol initialization. In this way, when a sensor node
wants to authenticate itself to another node, it does not have
to obtain its private key at the beginning of a new round.
Upon node revocation, the BS broadcasts the compromised
node IDs to all sensor nodes, each node then stores the
the
revoked IDs within the current round. We adopt
additively homomorphic encryption scheme in [29]
to
encrypt the plaintext of sensed data, in which a specific
operation performed on the plaintext is equivalent to the
operation performed on the ciphertext. Using this scheme
allows efficient aggregation of encrypted data at the CHs
and the BS, which also guarantees data confidentiality. In
the protocol initialization, the BS performs the following
operations of key predistribution to all the sensor nodes:

. Generate an encryption key k for the homomorphic
encryption scheme to encrypt data messages, where
k 2 ½m   1, m is a large integer.
. Generate the pairing parameters ðp; q; E=Fp ; GG1 ;
GG2 ; eÞ, as described in Section 3. Select a generator
P of GG1 stochastically.
. Choose two cryptographic hash functions: H , for the
point mapping hash function which maps strings to
elements in GG1 , and h, for mapping arbitrary inputs
to fixed-length outputs.

.

.

4.2 Key Management for Security
Assume that a leaf sensor node j transmits a message M to
its CH i, and encrypts the data using the encryption key k
from the additively homomorphic encryption scheme [29].
We denote the ciphertext of the encrypted message as C .
We adapt the algorithms of the IBS scheme from [24] to
CWSNs practically and provide the full algorithm in the
signature verification, where security is based on the DHP
in the multiplicative group. The IBS scheme in the proposed
SET-IBS consists of following three operations: extraction,
signing, and verification.
Extraction. Node j first obtains its private key as sekj ¼
 H ðIDj ktj Þ from msk and IDj , where IDj is its ID, and tj is
the time stamp of node j’s time interval in the current round
that is generated by its CH i from the TDMA control.
Signature signing. The sensor node j picks a random
number j 2 ZZ
q and computes j ¼ eðP ; P Þj . The sensor
node further computes
cj ¼ hðCj ktj kj Þ:

ð1Þ

Let

ð3Þ

j ¼ cj sekj þ jP ;
ð2Þ
where hj ; cj i is the digital signature of node j on the
encrypted message Cj . The broadcast message is now
concatenated in the form of hIDj ; tj ; Cj ; j ; cj i.
Verification. Upon receiving the message, each sensor
node verifies the authenticity in the following way. It checks
the time stamp of current time interval tj and determines
whether the received message is fresh. Then, if the time
stamp is correct, the sensor node further computes
j ¼ eðj ; P ÞeðH ðIDj ktj Þ;  Ppub Þcj ;
0
using the time stamp of current time interval tj . We will
have the formula below if the received message is authentic:
j ¼ eðj ; P ÞeðH ðIDj ktj Þ;  Ppub Þcj
0
¼ eðj ; P ÞeðH ðIDj ktj Þ;   P Þcj
¼ eðcj sekj þ jP ; P ÞeðH ðIDj ktj Þ;  P Þ cj
¼ eðcj sekj þ jP ; P Þeð H ðIDj ktj Þ; P Þ cj
¼ ðeðsekj ; P Þcj eðP ; P Þj Þeð H ðIDj ktj Þ; P Þ cj
¼ eðsekj ; P Þcj eðP ; P Þj eðsekj ; P Þ cj
¼ eðP ; P Þj ¼ j :
j Þ ¼ hðCj ktj kj Þ ¼ cj , which is equal to that in
If hðCj ktj k0
the received message,
the sensor node considers the
received message authentic, and propagates the message
to the next hop or user. If the verification above fails, the
sensor node considers the message as either bogus or a
replaced one, even a mistaken one, and ignores it.

4.3 Protocol Operation
After the protocol initialization, SET-IBS operates in rounds
during communication. Each round consists of a setup

phase and a steady-state phase. We suppose that all sensor
nodes know the starting and ending time of each round
because of the time synchronization.
The operation of SET-IBS is divided by rounds as shown
in Fig. 1, which is similar to other LEACH-like protocols.
Each round includes a setup phase for constructing clusters
from CHs, and a steady-state phase for transmitting data
from sensor nodes to the BS. In each round, the timeline is
divided into consecutive time slots by the TDMA control
[4]. Sensor nodes transmit the sensed data to the CHs in
each frame of
the steady-state phase. For fair energy
consumption, nodes are randomly elected as CHs in each
round, and other non-CH sensor nodes join clusters using
one-hop transmission, depending on the highest received
signal strength of CHs. To elect CHs in a new round, each
sensor node determines a random number and compares it
with a threshold. If the value is less than the threshold, the
sensor node becomes a CH for the current round. In this
way, the new CHs are self-elected based by the sensor
nodes themselves only on their local decisions; therefore,
SET-IBS functions without data transmission with each
other in the CH rotations.
Table 1 shows the full steps in one round of SET-IBS.
The setup phase consists of four steps, from Steps 1 to 4,
and the steady-state phase consists of the latter two steps.
In the setup phase, the time stamp Ts and node IDs are
used for the signature generation. Whereas in the steady-
state phase, the time stamp tj is used for the signature
generation securing the inner cluster communications, and

T nð Þ ¼

ð5Þ

8n 2 Gn ;

Ts is used for the signature generation securing the CHs-
to-BS data transmission.
In Step 1, at the beginning of the setup phase of a new
round, the BS first broadcasts its ID, a nonce (number used
once), and the denotation of the starting time Ts of the
current round to all sensor nodes, which is used for the
signature signing and verification in the setup phase.
In Step 2, a sensor node decides whether to become a CH
for the current round, based on the threshold T ðnÞ
compared with numbers from 0 to 1, which is set as follows:

j k

 Ecur nð Þ

Einit nð Þ
1     r mod 1

T nð Þ ¼ 0
8n 62 Gn :
Equation (5) of computing the threshold T ðnÞ in node n
is based on the LEACH protocol [4]. Note that we improve
the dynamic clustering algorithm preferably with multi-
plying the ratio of residual energy of the current sensor
node (i.e., Ecur ðnÞ
Einit ðnÞ ) to increase the energy efficiency in the
clustering, where Ecur ðnÞ is the current energy, and Einit ðnÞ
is the initial energy of the sensor node.  is a priori
determined value which stands for the desired percentage
of CHs during one round (e.g.,  ¼ 10%), r is the current
round number, and Gn is the set of sensor nodes that have
not been CHs in the last b1=c rounds. If the value of
determined number is less than the threshold, the sensor
node elects itself as a CH. The sensor node who decides to
become a CH broadcasts the advertisement message (adv) to
the neighboring nodes in the network, which is concate-
nated with the signature hi ; ci i.
In Step 3, the sensor node, which decides to be a leaf
node, picks a CH to join based on the largest received signal
strength of adv messages. Then, it communicates with CH i
by sending a join_request (join) message, which is con-
catenated with the destination CH’s ID IDi , its own ID IDj ,
time stamp Ts , and the digital signature hj ; cj i.

In Step 4, a CH i broadcasts an allocation message to its
cluster members for communication during the steady-state
phase, yet to be concatenated with the signature. The
allocation message include a time schedule hschedð. . . ;
IDj =tj ; . . .Þi from the TDMA control, which allocates a time
stamp IDj =tj for a leaf node j.
Once the setup phase is over, the network system turns
in which sensed data are
into the steady-state phase,
transmitted from sensor nodes to the BS.
In Step 5,
according to the TDMA schedule from Step 4, each leaf
sensor node j transmits the encrypted data Cj in a packet
hIDj ; tj ; Cj ; j ; cj i to its CH, which is concatenated with a
digital signature in a time slot tj , where the sender ID IDj
with tj is the destination identifier for the receiver CH. In
this way, each CH collects messages from all members in its
cluster, aggregates and fuses data.
In Step 6, CHs send the aggregated data F to the BS,
yet to be concatenated with the digital signature. The
steady-state phase consists of multiple reporting cycles of
data transmissions from leaf nodes to the CHs, and is
exceedingly long compared to the setup phase.

5 THE PROPOSED SET-IBOOS PROTOCOL

We present the SET protocol for CWSNs by using IBOOS
(SET-IBOOS)
in this section. The SET-IBOOS protocol
is designed with the same purpose and scenarios for
CWSNs with higher efficiency. The proposed SET-IBOOS
operates similarly to the previous SET-IBS, which has a
protocol initialization prior to the network deployment and
operates in rounds during communication . We first
introduce the protocol initialization, then describe the key
management of the protocol by using the IBOOS scheme,
and the protocol operations afterwards.

5.1 Protocol Initialization
To reduce the computation and storage costs of signature
signing processing in the IBS scheme, we improve SET-IBS
by introducing IBOOS for security in SET-IBOOS. The
operation of the protocol initialization in SET-IBOOS is
similar to that of SET-IBS; however, the operations of key
predistribution are revised for IBOOS. The BS does the
following operations of key predistribution in the network:

.

5.2 Key Management for Security
Assume that a leaf sensor node j transmits a message M to
its CH i, and we denote the ciphertext of the encrypted
message as Cj , which is encrypted by the same encryption
scheme in SET-IBS. We adapt the algorithms from [21] to

construct an IBOOS scheme for CWSNs, where security is
based on the DLP in the multiplicative group. The
corresponding private pairing parameters are preloaded
in the sensor nodes during the protocol initialization. The
IBOOS scheme in the proposed SET-IBOOS consists of
following four operations: extraction, offline signing, online
signing, and verification.
Extraction. Before the signature process, node j first
extracts the private key from the msk  and its identity ID,
as sekj ¼ ðRj ; sj Þ, where
Rj ¼ grj ;
sj ¼ rj þ H ðRj ; IDj Þ modq:

ð6Þ

b
Offline signing. At the offline stage, node j generates the
offline value h
j i with the time stamp of its time slot tj for
transmission, and store the knowledge for signing online
signature when it sends the message. Notice that, this
offline signature can be done by the sensor node itself or by
the trustful third party, for example, the CH sensor node.
Let X ¼ g , then
b
gsj ¼ grj gH ðRj ;IDj Þ modq ¼ RjXH ðRj ;IDj Þ modq :
j ¼ g tj :
Online signing. At this stage, node j computes the online
b
signature hj ; zj i based on the encrypted data Cj and the
j :
offline signature

ð7Þ

b
hj ¼ H ðCj ; IDj Þ;
b
zj ¼
j þ hj sj modq;
j ¼ g
j :

ð8Þ

ð9Þ

Then, node j sends the message to its destination with tj ,
Rj , and the online signature, in the form of hIDj ; tj ; Rj ;
j ; zj ; Cj i.
Verification. Upon receiving the message, each sensor
node verifies the authenticity in the following way. It checks
the current time stamp tj for freshness. Then, if the time
stamp is correct, the sensor node further computes the
j XhjH ðRj ;IDj Þ modq , then check if
values of gzj and jRhj
gzj ¼? jRhj
j XhjH ðRj ;IDj Þ modq :
For correctness, we will have the formula below if the
received message is authentic:
b
jRhj XhjH ðRj ;IDj Þ modq
b
¼ g
j grj hj g hiH ðRj ;IDj Þ modq
b
¼ g
j þhj ðrj þðH ðRj ;IDj Þ modqÞÞ
¼ g
j þhj sj modq ¼ gzj :
i XhiH ðRi ;IDi Þ modq are equal
If the values of gzj and jRhi
the node i considers the
from the received message,
received message authentic, accepts it, and propagates
the message to the next hop or user. If the verification
above fails, the sensor node considers the message as
either bogus or a replaced one, even a mistaken one, then
rejects or ignores it.

Operations in SET-IBOOS

.

Comparing the SET-IBS, SET-IBOOS requires less
energy for computation and storage. Moreover, the
SET-IBOOS is more suitable for node-to-node com-
munications in CWSNs, since the computation is
lighter to be executed.
In SET-IBOOS, the offline signature is executed by
the CH sensor nodes; thus, sensor nodes do not
have to execute the offline algorithm before it
wants to sign on a new message. Furthermore, the
offline sign phase does not use any sensed data or
secret information for signing. This is particularly
useful for CWSNs because leaf sensor nodes do not
need auxiliary communication for renewing the
offline signature.

6.1 Protocol Characteristics
In this part, we summarize the characteristics of
the
proposed SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS protocols. Table 3 shows
a general summary of comparison of the characteristics of

TABLE 3
Comparison of Characteristics of the Proposed Protocols with
Other Secure Data Transmission Protocols

5.3 Protocol Operation
The proposed SET-IBOOS operates similarly to that of SET-
IBS. SET-IBOOS works in rounds during communication,
and the self-elected CHs are decided based on their local
decisions, thus it functions without data transmission in the
CH rotations. Table 2 shows the full steps of SET-IBOOS in
one round, in which the setup phase is from Steps 1 to 4,
and the steady-state phase consists of Steps 5 and 6.
Step 1 in Table 2 is similar to that in Table 1. However,
the differences in Steps 2, 3, and 4 are the digital signatures
that are changed from the ID-based signatures to the online
signatures hi ; zi i of the IBOOS scheme.
Once the setup phase is over, the network system turns
into the steady-state phase, in which data are transmitted to
the BS. The steady-state operates similarly to that in Steps 5
and 6 of Table 1, where the ID-based signatures are changed
into the online signatures of the IBOOS scheme.
For convenience, we show a flowchart of the proposed
secure data transmission protocols in Appendix C.2

6 PROTOCOL FEATURES

The protocol characteristics and hierarchical clustering
solutions are presented in this section. We first summarize
the features of
the proposed SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS
protocols as follows:

.

.

Both the proposed SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS proto-
cols provide secure data transmission for CWSNs
with concrete ID-based settings, which use ID
information and digital signature for authentication.
Thus, both SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS fully solve the
orphan-node problem from using the symmetric key
management for CWSNs.
The proposed secure data transmission protocols
are with concrete ID-based settings, which use ID
information and digital signature for verification.

SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS with prior ones, in which metrics
are used to evaluate whether a security protocol
is
appropriate for CWSNs. We explain each metric as follows:

.

.

.

.

Key management. the key cryptographies used in
the protocol to achieve secure data transmission,
which consist of symmetric and asymmetric key-
based security.
. Neighborhood authentication. used for secure access
and data transmission to nearby sensor nodes, by
authenticating with each other. Here, “limited”
means the probability of neighborhood authentica-
tion, where only the nodes with the shared pairwise
key can authenticate each other.
Storage cost. represents the requirement of
security keys stored in sensor node’s memory.
. Network scalability.
indicates whether a security
protocol is able to scale without compromising the
security requirements. Here, “comparatively low”
means that, compared with SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS,
in the secure data transmission with a symmetric
key management, the larger network scale increases,
the more orphan nodes appear in the network, and
vice versa [2].
Communication overhead. the security overhead in the
data packets during communication.
Computational overhead. the energy cost and compu-
tation efficiency on the generation and verification of
the certificates or signatures for security.
. Attack resilience. the types of attacks that security
protocol can protect against.

the

6.2 Secure Data Transmission with Hierarchical
Clustering
In large-scale CWSNs, multihop data transmission is used
for transmission between the CHs to the BS, where the
direct communication is not possible due to the distance
or obstacles between them. The version of the proposed
SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS protocols for CWSNs can be
extended using multihop routing algorithms,
to form
secure data transmission protocols for hierarchical clusters.
The solutions to this extension could be achieved by
applying the following two routing models:

1. The multihop planar model. A CH node transmits data
to the BS by forwarding its data to its neighbor
nodes, in turn the data are sent to the BS. We have
proposed an energy-efficient routing algorithm for
hierarchically clustered WSNs in [30], and it
is
suitable for the proposed secure data transmission
protocols.
2. The cluster-based hierarchical method. The network is
broken into clustered layers, and the data packages
travel from a lower cluster head to a higher one, in
turn to the BS, for example, [31].

7 PROTOCOL EVALUATION

In this section, we first introduce the three attack models of
the adversaries, and provide the security analysis of the
proposed protocols against these attacks. We then present
results obtained from calculations and simulations. For the

network simulat ions, we use the network simulator
OMNeT++ 3.0 [32] to simulate SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS,
and we focus on the energy consumption spent on message
propagation and computation.

7.1 Security Analysis
To evaluate the security of the proposed protocols, we have
to investigate the attack models in WSNs that threaten the
proposed protocols, and the cases when an adversary
(attacker) exists in the network. Afterwards, we detail the
solutions and countermeasures of the proposed protocols,
against various adversaries and attacks.

7.1.1 Attack Models
In this paper, we group attack models into three categories
according to their attacking means as follows, and study how
these attacks may be applied to affect the proposed protocols:

.

Passive attack on wireless channel. Passive attackers are
able to perform eavesdropping at any point of the
network, or even the whole communication of the
network. Thus, they can undertake traffic analysis or
statistical analysis based on the monitored or
eavesdropped messages.
. Active attack on wireless channel. Active attackers have
greater ability than passive adversaries, which can
tamper with the wireless channels. Therefore, the
attackers can forge, reply, and modify messages.
Especially in WSNs, various types of active attacks
can be triggered by attackers, such as bogus and
rep layed rou t ing in forma t ion a t tack , s inkho le
and wormhole attack, selective forwarding attack,
HELLO flood attack, and Sybil attack [2], [23].
. Node compromising attack. Node compromising at-
tackers are the most powerful adversaries against
the proposed protocols as we considered. The
attackers can physically compromise sensor nodes,
by which they can access the secret information
stored in the compromised nodes, for example, the
security keys. The attackers also can change the
inner state and behavior of the compromised sensor
node, whose actions may be varied from the premier
protocol specifications.

7.1.2 Solutions to Attacks and Adversaries
The proposed SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS provide different
types of security services to the communication for CWSNs,
in both setup phase and steady-state phase. Both in SET-IBS
and SET-IBOOS, the encryption of the message provides
confidentiality, the hash function provides integrity, the
nonce and time stamps provide freshness, and the digital
signature provides authenticity and nonrepudiation:

.

Solutions to passive attacks on wireless channel. In the
proposed SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS, the sensed data
are encrypted by the homomorphic encryption
scheme from [29], which deals with eavesdropping.
Thus, the passive adversaries cannot decrypt the
eavesdropped message without the decryption key.
Furthermore, both SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS use the
key management of concrete ID-based encryption.
Based on the DHP assumpt ion ment ioned in

758

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, VOL. 25, NO. 3, MARCH 2014

.

.

Section 3, the ID-based key management in the
proposed protocols is IND-ID-CCA secure (semantic
secure against an adaptive ID-based chosen cipher-
text attack) and IND-ID-CPA secure (semantic
secure against an adaptive ID-based chosen plaintext
attack). As a result, properties of the proposed
secure data transmission for CWSNs settle the
countermeasures to passive attacks.
Solutions to active attacks on wireless channel. Focusing
on the resilience against certain attacks to CWSNs
mentioned in attack models, SET-IBS and SET-
IBOOS works well against active attacks. Most kinds
of attacks are pointed to CHs of acting as inter-
mediary nodes because of the limited functions by
the leaf nodes in a cluster-based architecture. Since
attackers do not have valid digital signature to
concatenate with broadcast messages for authentica-
tion, attackers cannot pretend as the BS or CHs to
trigger attacks. Therefore, SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS
are resilient, and robust to the sinkhole and selective
forwarding attacks because the CHs being attacked
are capable to ignore all the communication packets
with bogus node IDs or bogus digital signatures.
Together with round-rotating mechanism and digi-
tal signature schemes, SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS are
resilient to the HELLO flood attacks involving CHs.
Solutions to node compromising attacks. In case of
attacks from a node compromising attacker, the
compromised sensor node cannot be trusted any-
more to fulfill the security requirements by key
managements. In the case that the node has been
compromised but works normally, the WSN system
needs an intrusion detection mechanism to detect
the compromised node [33], and has to replace the
compromised node manually or abandon using it. In
this part , we invest igate the influence of
the
remaining sensor nodes, and evaluate the properties
only to that part of the network.
Since each round in the protocol operations terminates in
a predefined time, SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS satisfy the
property of protocol execution termination, depending on
the local timer of the sensor nodes. The CH nodes are
elected based only on their local decisions; therefore, both
SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS operate if there exists an active or
compromising attacker. To eliminate the compromised
sensor node in the network, all
the revoked IDs of
compromised nodes will be broadcast by the BS at the
beginning of the current round. In this way, the compro-
mised nodes can be prevented from either electing as CHs
or joining clusters in this round. Furthermore, using either
the IBS scheme or the IBOOS scheme has at least two
advantages. First, it eliminates the utilization of certificates
and auxiliary authentication information. Therefore, the
message overhead for security can be reduced, especially
with IBOOS. Also, because only the compromised node IDs
have to be stored, it requires very small storage space for
the node revocation. Since the length of a user’s ID is
usually only 12 bytes, the storage of compromised user’s
IDs do not require much storage space.

7.2 Message Size of Data Transmission
In this part, we do the quantitative calculation of the
message packet size on data transmission in the steady state
(main phase) of the different protocols for comparison. In
the proposed SET-IBS, the message packet size on transmis-
sion for node j is described in Section 4, which equals to
jIDi j þ jIDj j þ jtj j þ jCj j þ jj j þ jcj j:
cj ¼ jhðCj ktj kj Þj is a hash value, which is 20 bytes when
SHA-1 [34] is used. Although most of existing WSNs
constructed in real-world use no more than 200 nodes [1], a
large scale WSN could consist of hundreds of nodes or
more in the future. Thus in this paper, we set the length of
node IDs as 2 bytes. In addition, the time stamp jtj j is very
small like 1 byte, and jCj j is assumed as 20 bytes. The total
message size of a transmission packet is 44 þ jj j bytes,
whereas jj j
is variable. For example, when using the
Tate pairing [28] for elliptic curve cryptography (ECC),
the order q of GG1 and GG2 could be a 160-bit prime, if the
required security level of ECC is equivalent to RSA with
1,024-bit keys (RSA-1,024) [35], which provides the cur-
rently accepted security level.
In this way,
the total
message size of a data packet is 64 bytes in SET-IBS.
Moreover, p could be a 512-bit prime to achieve higher
level of security, where GG is a q-order multiplicative
subgroup of the finite field F
p2 [22].
In SET-IBOOS, the message packet size on transmission
for node j is described in Section 5, which equals to
jIDi j þ jIDj j þ jtj j þ jCj j þ jRj j þ jj j þ jzj j;
the length of ID and t are same to that of SET-IBS, and jCj j is
b
assumed as 20 bytes. In the online signature hRj ; j ; zj i, the
length of jzj ¼ j
j þ ðhs modqÞj depends on the size of q,
b
which is set to 160 bits long to achieve a similar security
j
level of SET-IBS, because the offline signature
is a
the cyclic group GG’s
negative exponential value of
generator g (in (7)) that is very small. For the other parts
b
of the signature hj ; zj i, jj j is the exponentiation to the
j , from the negative exponential function ( tj , in
power
(8)) of the generator g, thus its value is very small, which is
assumed as 2 bytes at most in this paper. Similarly, the
length of Rj is assumed as 2 bytes. Therefore, the total
message size of a data packet is 48 bytes in SET-IBOOS.
We compare the proposed SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS with
other secure protocols that use a symmetric key manage-
ment, SecLEACH protocol [8] and multilevel Tesla-based
protocol [36]. We calculate the packet size in these protocols
in the same way, which equals to
jIDj j þ jIDCH j þ jnoncej þ jCj j þ jmack ðIDj jIDCH jnoncejCj Þj;
in SecLEACH protocol, where mac is the message authen-

	
tication code. And it equals to
j þ jP K j þ jAIj j;
jIDj j þ jtj j þ jCj j þ jS igSK hðIDj jtj jCj Þ

in multilevel Tesla-based protocol, where S ig is the
signature based on the secret key, SK=P K is the public/
private key pair for signing and verification, and AI is
the auxiliary information for security referred to the
sensor node.

Parameter Settings for the Energy Consumption in Simulations

Fig. 2. Message size for transmission compared to the number of nodes.

Fig. 2 shows the total message sizes in different protocols
for data transmission, which achieve a similar security level
to RSA-1024, by concerning the number of sensor nodes. We
can see that the proposed SET-IBS has smaller message size
than multilevel Tesla-based protocol. At the same time, it
generates larger message size as compared to SecLEACH.
However, the orphan node problem is fully solved in SET-
IBS. We can also see that the proposed SET-IBOOS has the
smallest message size than all the other protocols. We
further do network simulations on energy consumption and
computation cost in the next section.

7.3 Simulation Results
Comprehending the extra energy consumption by the
auxiliary security overhead and prolonging the network
lifetime are essential in the proposed SET-IBS and SET-
IBOOS . To evaluate the energy consumption of
the
computational overhead for security in communication,
we consider three metrics for the performance evaluation:
Network lifetime, system energy consumption, and the number of
alive nodes. For the performance evaluation, we compare the
proposed SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS with LEACH protocol
[4] and SecLEACH protocol [8]:

.

. Network lifetime (the time of FND)—We use the most
general metric in this paper, the time of first node
dies (FND), which indicates the duration that the
sensor network is fully functional [1]. Therefore,
maximizing the time of FND in a WSN means to
prolong the network lifetime.
The number of alive nodes—The ability of sensing and
collecting information in a WSN depends on the set of
alive nodes (nodes that have not failed). Therefore,
we evaluate the functionality of the WSN depending
on counting the number of alive nodes in the network.
Total system energy consumption—It refers to the
amount of energy consumed in a WSN. We evaluate
the variation of energy consumption in secure data
transmission protocols.
In the network simulation experiments, 100 nodes are
randomly distributed in a 100 m  100 m area, with a fixed
BS located near part of the area, as shown in the figure in
the Appendix. All the sensor nodes periodically sense
events and transmit the data packet to the BS. We assume

.

that the sensor CPU is a low-power high-performance Intel
PXA255 processer of 400 MHz, which has been widely used
in many sensor products, for example, Crossbow Stargate
[37].
Table 4 lists up the parameter settings for the energy
consumption in the network simulations. In the simulations,
we use the same radio energy model in [4], and the other
parameters are from [8], [21], [22], [24]. We assume that the
BS has unlimited energy. For clustering, we properly set
the desired percentage of CH nodes  ¼ 10% during one
round. In addition, on simulating the SecLEACH protocol,
we choose a security level sl ¼ 0:98 for a fixed length of a key
ring m ¼ 100. Thus, the probability that two nodes will share
a key is Ps ¼ 0:87, which is also referred to as the expected
orphan rate of the orphan node problem.
Fig. 3 illustrates the time of FND using different
protocols. We apply confidence intervals to the simulation
results, and a certain percentage (confidence level) is set to
90 percent. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of system lifetime
using SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS versus LEACH protocol and
SecLEACH protocol. The simulation results demonstrate
that the system lifetime of SET-IBOOS is longer than that of
SET-IBS and SecLEACH protocol. The time of FND in both
SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS is shorter than that of LEACH
protocol due to the security overhead on computation cost
of the IBS process.

Fig. 3. Comparison of FND time in different protocols.

760

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, VOL. 25, NO. 3, MARCH 2014

simulation results show that the proposed SET-IBS and
SET-IBOOS protocols have better performance than existing
secure protocols for CWSNs. With respect to both computa-
tion and communication costs, we pointed out the merits
that using SET-IBOOS with less auxiliary security overhead
is preferred for secure data transmission in CWSNs.

8 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we first reviewed the data transmission issues
and the security issues in CWSNs. The deficiency of the
symmetric key management for secure data transmission
has been discussed. We then presented two secure and
efficient data transmission protocols, respectively,
for
CWSNs, SET-IBS, and SET-IBOOS.
In the evaluation
section, we provided feasibility of the proposed SET-IBS
and SET-IBOOS with respect to the security requirements
and analysis against routing attacks. SET-IBS and SET-
IBOOS are efficient in communication and applying the ID-
based cryptosystem, which achieves security requirements
in CWSNs, as well as solved the orphan node problem in
the secure transmission protocols with the symmetric key
management. Lastly, the comparison in the calculation and
