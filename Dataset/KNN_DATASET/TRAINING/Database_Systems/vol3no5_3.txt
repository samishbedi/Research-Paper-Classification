ABSTRACT 
Library  automation  not  only  improves  the  image  of  the  library  services but  also provides  additional  services  to  the users with 
the  existing  staff.  It  provides  equal  opportunities  to  all  staff  members  for  organizational  learning,  reengineering,  and 
benchmarking.  The  present  study  demonstrates  and  elaborates  the  library  automation  software  and  it  types  used  in  self 
financing  engineering  college  (SFEC)  libraries  in  duration  wise  analysis.  A  well  structured  questionnaire  was  distributed 
among library professionals in engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu to evaluate the library automation software.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
The  term  library  automation  was  generally  used  in 
the past for house keeping operations of the  library. Today it 
has  expended  its  scope  and  includes  all  those  technologies 
which  libraries  and  information  centres  use  for  collection, 
processing, 
storage, 
retrieval, 
dissemination, 
and 
transmission  of  all  types  of  information  at  local,  regional, 
national, and international level. 
 

According  to  Daniel,  library  automation  assured  a 
great deal of importance in libraries in the mid-1960s.  Since 
then,  it  has  become  a  house  hold  word  in  librarianship.  
Library  automation  may  be  defined  as  the  application  of 
automatic  and  semi  automatic  data  processing  machines  to 
perform 
functions 
such 
as 
acquisition, 
circulation 
cataloguing,  reference  service,  and  serial  control. This  is  the 
reason  for  the  librarian  to  urge  for  developing  e-resources 
for the effectives and efficient library service. 
 
2.  ICT IN LIBRARIES 
 

The 
communication 
and 
information 
term, 
technologies  (ICT),  refers  to  forms  of  technology  that  are 
used 
to 
transmit,  store,  create,  share  or  exchange 
information.  This  broad  definition  of  ICT  includes  such 
technologies  as:  radio,  television,  video,  DVD,  telephone 
(both  fixed  line  and  mobile  phones),  satellite  systems, 
computer and network hardware and software; as well as the 
equipment  and  services  associated  with  these  technologies, 
such  as  videoconferencing  and  electronic  mail.  In  recent 
years, there is a visible shift from the old ways to the modern 
ways  of  information  delivery  systems.  With  the  advent  of 
global  information  society,  information  and  communication 
technologies are  increasingly being adopted as effective  tool 
for  reaching  rural  communities.  Yet  the  benefits  of  the 
information  revolution  are  still  much  debated,  particularly, 
in the case of developing countries like India. 

 
liberalization  policies 
 However,  privatization, 
 
aimed  at  increasing  competition  in  this  strategic  sector  have 
increased  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  providing  ICT 
infrastructure.  They  have  also  hastened  the  adoption  by 
many  developing  countries  of  new  networking  and 
telecommunication  technologies,  helped  by  their  rapidly 
declining  costs.  Still,  private  telecommunication  companies 
hesitate  to  provide  infrastructure  for  rural  and  low-density 
areas  and  Governments  still  have  a  critical  role  to  play  in 
direct  investment,  creating  and  enabling  environment  or 
such  interventions  as  setting  up  universal  access  funds  by 
which  companies  can help Governments pay  for  community 
networks  and public  access points. Recent  estimates  suggest 
that  80  per  cent  of  total  ICT  expenditures  go  to  content,  15 
per cent  to  software and application  technologies and only 5 
per  cent  to  infrastructure.  In  recent  years,  the  Asian  and 
Pacific region have invested more heavily than other regions 
into  this  area,  channeling  close  to  10  per  cent  of  its 
expenditure in basic ICT infrastructure.  
 
 
Information  Communication  Technology  (ICT)  is 
one  of  the  important  buzzwords  of  today’s  IT  world.  It  has 
changed  the  society  into  information  society  and our way of 
life.  It  has  been  integrated  in  every  walk  of  our  life.  Its 
impact has been evident in railway, air reservations, banking 
and 
insurance  sectors,  postal  services,  biotechnology, 
bioinformatics,  biomedical  sciences,  health  care  sector, 
telemedicine,  media  and  communications, 
teaching  –
learning, 
library  and 
information 
services,  printing 
technology,  e-resources,  digitization  of  documents,  digital 
library, 
library  networking, 
e-commerce,  & 
trade, 
entertainment, and what not? It has penetrated in everywhere 
and  its makes our  life comfortable and easy. A major part of 
the  functionality  of  the  computer  and  communication 
technologies  will  be  vitalized  by  the  software  and  it  will

perception.  Software  is  the  program  that  runs  the  computer 
to  produce  the  required  results.  It  is,  in  fact,  the  most 
important  component  of  the  automation  process.  Someone 
said,  “A  computer  without  software  is  similar  to  a  man 
without  his  brain,  or  a  library  with  neither  books  nor 
librarians”. Therefore, on principle,  the selection of software 
comes  before  hardware.  When  we  talk  about  library 
software,  we  mean 
library 
the  software  needed  for 
housekeeping  routines  and  information  retrieval  services. 
Hundreds  of  library  packages  have  been  developed  and  run 
successfully  in  advanced  countries  and  there  are  many 
directories  and  other  tools  available  that  help  librarians  to 
select suitable software for their libraries.

Technology  (IITs)  have  been  recognized  all  over  the  world 
as  centers  of  excellence  in  learning,  training  and  research  in 
the  fields  of  engineering  and  technology.  This  paper 
describes  the  present  state  of  computerization  in  six  IIT

software,  applications,  databases,  CD-ROMs,  online  search 
services, networking and marketing of products and services. 
Future  plans  have  also  been  covered  where  available.  The 
data  was  gathered  through  questionnaires.  In  addition, 
annual  reports  and  other  primary  documents  of  the  libraries 
were  used.  Ahmad  &  Iqbal  (2009)  found  that  the  Library 
automation  fulfills  the  above  demand  of  libraries  by 
providing  the  library  activities  as:  very  efficiently,  rapidly,

that  already  exists  within  library  walls  electronically  to 
patrons.  To  create  new  digital  resources  locally,  and  to 
integrate  local  digital  resources  with  remote  ones.  The 
number  of  people  accessing  digital  collections  through  the 
WWW  also  shows  explosive  rates  of  growth.  Finally, 
internationalization 
is  making  a  “global

The  anova  two  way  model  is  applied  for  further 
discussion.    At  one  point  the  computed  anova  value  is  5.10 
which  is greater  than  its  tabulated value at 5 percent  level of 
Yes 
significance.    Hence  variation  with  respect  to  library 
18 
application  software  used  in  the  libraries  is  statistically 
0 
(100.00) 
identified  as  significant.    At  another  point  the  computed 
anova  value  is  3.52 which  is  greater  than  its  tabulated  value 
1 
69 
at 5 percent level of significance.  Hence, it  is found that the 
(1.43) 
(98.57) 
variation in the library application software in the libraries of 
6 
46 
self  financing  engineering  colleges  in  Tamil  Nadu  is 
(11.54) 
(88.46) 
significant.     A similar result has been observed with respect 
7 
133 
to duration wise of library application software in the library 
 (5.00) 
(95.00) 
network of the selected self financing engineering colleges. 
 
               (Figures in parentheses denote percentage) 
 
 
The  table  5  indicates  the  institutional  duration  wise  database  software  facilities  in  the  self  financing  engineering 
colleges  in Tamil Nadu. All  the  long duration has database  software  facilities  in  their  libraries. But only one medium duration 
institution and six (11.54) institutions are not having database software facilities in their library premises.

Table 32 presents data based on  institution duration 
wise,  in  relation  to  Relational  Data  Base  Management 
Software  use  pattern  in  the  self  financing  engineering 
college  libraries.   Majority of  long duration  institutions have 
M.S.  Access  (42.86%)  data  base  software.    Most  of  the 
medium duration institutions (44.23%) have oracle and M.S.  

Access  (36.53%)  in  their  libraries.    Majority  of  the  short 
duration  institutions  have  SQL  server  (41.67%)  data  base 
software.  It  could  be  seen  clearly  from  the  above  discussion 
that  the  possession  of  SQL  and  Sybase  forms  of  data 
management  system  is  common  among  long  duration 
institutions than those of others.

Chi-square  test  is  applied  for  further  discussion.  
The  computed  Chi-square  value  is  18.90  which  is  greater 
than  its  tabulated  value  at  5  percent  level  of  significance.  
Hence,  the  difference  among  the  institution  duration wise  is 
statistically  identified  as  significant with  respect  to  database 
software facility. 

10. CONCLUSION 

              The self financing engineering college libraries are 
having  95  per  cent  of  the  colleges  use  the  library 
automation  software.  In  the  case  of  different  commercial 
library  softwares  the  Auto  lib  takes  the  first  position  and 
Liba  soft  the  second  and  In  house  prepared  software  the 
third  position  in  the  utilization  of  the  library  automation 
software. But in the case of long duration institutions all the 
libraries has automation facilities.
