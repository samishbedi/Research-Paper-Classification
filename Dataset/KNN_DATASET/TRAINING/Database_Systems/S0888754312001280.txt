Studies aiming to explore the involvement of host genetic factors to determine susceptibility to develop disease
and individual's response to the infection with Mycobacterium leprae have increased in recent years. To
address this issue, we have developed a Leprosy Susceptible Human Gene Database (LSHGD) to integrate leprosy
and human associated 45 genes by profound literature search. This will serve as a user-friendly and interactive
platform to understand the involvement of human polymorphisms (SNPs) in leprosy, independent
genetic control over both susceptibility to leprosy and its association with multi-drug resistance of M. leprae.
As the first human genetic database in leprosy it aims to provide information about the associated genes,
corresponding protein sequences, available three dimensional structures and polymorphism related to leprosy.
In conclusion, this will serve as a multifunctional valuable tool and convenient information platform
which is freely available at http://www.vit.ac.in/leprosy/leprosy.htm and enables the user to retrieve information
of their interest.

1. Introduction
The field of human genetics of infectious diseases aims to define the
genetic variations accounting for inter-individual variability in the
course of human infections [1]. Leprosy (Hansen's disease) is a chronic
granulomatous infectious disease of human whose etiological agent,
Mycobacterium leprae, was identified by G. H. A. Hansen in the 19th century.
In 2011, there were new cases reported, predominantly in Asia, Africa,
and Latin America [2]. According to official reports received from
WHO during 2011 from 130 countries and territories, the global registered
prevalence of leprosy at the beginning of 2011 stood at 192,246
cases, while the number of new cases detected during 2010 was
228,474 (excluding the small number of cases in Europe). Leprosy is
an unusual disease in many aspects, not the least of which is that, despite
effective multi-drug therapy, the steady state number of leprosy
cases is about equal to the annual number of new cases. These numbers
are evidence of a high transmission rate. Until the modes and sources of
transmission are well understood, it is unlikely that we will be able to
interfere with the transmission or be able to eradicate this disease. Leprosy
is primarily a disease of the skin and peripheral nervous system.
There were also studies that involved the eyes, bone, lymph nodes,
nasal structures, and testes [3]. The Ridley–Jopling classification uses
histopathological and clinical features and the bacteriological index as
well. It classifies leprosy in tuberculoid (TT), borderline tuberculoid
(BT), borderline (BB), borderline-lepromatous (BL), and lepromatous
(LL) categories. In another classification by WHO, multibacillary leprosy
includes the lepromatous (LL), borderline lepromatous (BL), and borderline
(BB) forms, and paucibacillary leprosy encompasses the tuberculoid
(TT) and borderline tuberculoid (BT) forms [4]. During the past
years, few studies aiming to explore the host susceptibility to leprosy
have been explored and published. The results of epidemiological studies
(twin studies and complex segregation analyses) [5–7] and
genome-wide analysis (linkage and association) [8] in leprosy infection
clearly indicated the involvement of host genetic factors to determine
susceptibility to develop the disease and the individual's response to
the infection with M. leprae. Host genetic factors may therefore largely
determine which exposed individuals develop disease. Several studies
indicate that leprosy pathogenesis is a three-step process (i) group of
genes controls susceptibility to infection, (ii) different genes control
the clinical manifestation of disease, and (iii) genes influencing the development,
in a proportion of affected individuals, of leprosy reversal
reaction type 1 (RR1). A recent human genome-wide linkage or association
studies have observed a significant association with or linked to
leprosy in various genes C3, C4B, CCDC122, CCL3, CCL5, CFB, COL3A1,
CR1, CTLA4, DEFB1, FCN2, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HSPA1A,
ICAM1, IFNG, IL10, IL12B, IL12RB1, IL12RB2, LACC1, LAMA2, LRRK2, LTA,

RIPK2, SLC11A1, TAP1, TIRAP, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TNF, and TNFSF15,
[5,9–11]. Recent advances in high-throughput genotyping, next generation
sequencing, and very high-density microarrays have generated a
tremendous amount of human genetic variation data associated with
human traits and diseases especially Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
(SNPs), Copy Number Variations (CNVs), and Insertions and deletions
(Indels). There were quite a lot of studies that have reported the direct

involvement of SNPs in host genetics susceptibility to leprosy. SNPs provide
an opportunity to understand the association between genotype
and phenotype in a much broader manner. These mounting studies on
SNPs insist their role in better understanding the resultant phenotypic
variations among individuals with an endeavor towards new drug
design and development. Mapping of SNPs to protein domains and analyzing
at the structural level will reveal the full extent to which they
can alter the interactivity of proteins. To understand the key structural
changes induced by SNPs, we have included three dimensional (3D)
structures of the corresponding proteins in this database. Although
human associated studies related to leprosy have received great attention
from experimental researchers; there is no single comprehensive
database to address human leprosy associated gene information. The
amount of genetic data generating will also increase drastically in the
coming years. To address this issue the need for a comprehensive and
well organized collection of genetic data from multiple published studies
is urgently needed to provide information in one cluster. Currently
there are few databases available related to leprosy such as The Leprosy
VNTR Database [12], the Leprosy—Mycobacterium Leprae Database
[13], and the Database of Drug Targets for Resistant Pathogens
(DDTRP) [14] stating the information related to M. leprae and its drug
resistance. In this present study, we describe a new web based interface
called LSHGD which provides detailed information for researchers who
are interested in analyzing the involvement and association of human
genome in leprosy. Our main urge is to provide a convenient information
platform for molecular epidemiologists and clinicians working on
leprosy. The information about the 45 leprosy susceptible human
genes [15–56] is shown in Table 1. A primary function of the database
is to provide a way of identifying associated SNPs that are likely to
have an impact on molecular function. As the first database, freely accessible
LSHGD aims to provide comprehensive sets of genetic information
both at the sequence and structural levels for extending functional
analysis.
2. Data collection
The main goal of our presented work is to develop an interface that
provides a direct link between leprosy and human associated genes.
The gene information regarding human leprosy susceptible genes
[15–56] are provided in Table 1. The data contents can scale up in two
ways. (i) The literature information on the impact of human genes and
its association with leprosy were compiled from published literatures
according to Pub Med (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/), OMIM
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/), and UniProtKB (http://www.
uniprot.org/) [57]. OMIM contains textual information, pictures, and reference
information. It also contains copious links to NCBI's Entrez database
of MEDLINE articles and sequence information. UniProt was used
to validate the involvement of gene in mutation; where this gene is implicated:
diseases, a selected bibliography with hyperlinks to MEDLINE
abstracts. (ii) The genomic information types include genes, chromosomal
regions, natural variants (SNPs), associated proteins and their
pathways, etc. The SNP information of associated genes was retrieved
from the NCBI dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/). The annotated
sequence is required to determine the functional class (nsSNP,
cds-synon, UTR, and intronic) of the SNP. Nucleotide coordinates (numerical
position of a nucleotide in a gene sequence) and genotypic variation
information were also obtained from this sequence. We retrieved
related information from Public databases and gene annotation includes
NCBI [58], OMIM [57], UniProt [59], Ensembl [60], PDB [61], HGNC [62]
and KEGG [63].
2.1. Database design
We provide an intuitive, well organized and user friendly web interface
that allows users to explore the detailed information of leprosy
susceptible human genes. It includes gene name, gene ID, chromosome
number, chromosomal position, chromosomal orientation, gene function,
taxonomic identifier, RefSeq_protein, RefSeq_mRNA, OMIM ID,
HGNC ID, Pub Med ID, genotypic variation, residue change, function
class, SNP reference, associated protein, associated PDB ID, UniProt ID,
and associated pathways. Majorly, sequence information was incorporated
from NCBI (DNA), protein related information from UniProt and
protein structures from PDB. Clicking links leads to more detailed
information.
2.2. LSHGD organization and system design
Upon accessing LSHGD (Link: http://www.vit.ac.in/leprosy/leprosy.

named “Gene Database” allows the user to specifically choose the type
of information from the check box menu that includes gene information,
chromosomal information, associated protein information, and
natural variants information from the database. A click on the third interactive
button named “Classification of Gene”, allows the user to visualize
the classification of human genes susceptible to leprosy based on
associated protein mechanisms. A click on the last interactive button
named “Associated protein study” allows the user to find several
other protein associated studies in different stages of leprosy. A click
on the last interactive button named “Link to Other Database” allows
user to link other related databases Leprosy—Mycobacterium Leprae
Database [13], and Database of Drug Targets for Resistant Pathogens
(DDTRP). The following interfaces are displayed in Fig. 1. LSHGD consists
of three major software components: an Apache HTTP server, a
MySQL database and an Aspx script. The back end data analysis programs
were written in asp script using the Microsoft Visual Studio
2008 tool.
2.3. Database implementation
A maximum of 45 genes are displayed in the interface. In gene
information the interface provides related information such as
Gene Symbol, Gene Name, Gene Function, Entrez Gene ID,
RefSeq_Protein, RefSeq_mRNA, OMIM_ID, PubMed_ID, HGNC_ID,
Primary Reference related to leprosy susceptibility, population
studied, pathway Information and other cross references. Pathway
information for each gene allows the user to identify disease related
and associated pathways. Ethnicity will provide information
about the predisposition of leprosy genes in different populations.
Similarly, Gene_Name, Gene_ID, Chromosome_Number, Chromosomal_Position
and Orientation in Chromosomal Information
have been provided. These information will definitely provide the
user the information about susceptibility of genes in a specific
chromosomal region. Notably, gene information and chromosome
information will serve as genomic platform for database users. To
explore the possible relationships between genes and diseases we
have incorporated information about natural variants. However,
only a small subset of SNP information has been documented. It is
easy to determine a preliminary profile of the relationship between
genes and diseases using the information such as Gene Symbol,
Entrez Gene ID, Associated SNP, Genotypic Variation, Residue
Change, Functional Annotation, Consequence of Transcript and
SNP Associated with other Disease. Information such as functional
annotation and consequence of transcript encoded have been provided
for the significant SBNPs by GWAS and pathway information
for each gene in the natural variants and gene information interface
of the revised database. Similarly, Gene Name, Associated protein,
Chromosomal position, UniProt_ID, Associated_PDB_ID and
Associated_Pathway in protein information exist. From this natural
variants and protein information result table, the user can interlink
SNP associated information at the structural level. These interfaces
created in this database will satisfy the demands of the scientific
community by providing in depth knowledge about leprosy association
with human variants.
2.4. Designed instruction for users
The freely accessible LSHGD available at http://www.vit.ac.in/
leprosy/leprosy.htm aims to provide a comprehensive set of genetic
information both at the sequence and structural levels for extending
functional analysis. The database is composed of five interactive buttons
in the main display (Fig. 2) and explained their functions by considering
TLR1 as example.
(i) Main Page: the database is composed of five interactive buttons
in the main display namely
Home, Gene Database, Classification of genes, Associated protein
study and Link to other databases. Home is the main
page of the database. By clicking, the user can access the summarized
introduction about the database (Fig. 2A).
(ii) Gene Database: This represents the main characteristics of 45
leprosy susceptible human genes. Search for genes in LSHGD
by using the drop down menu provided in the interface.
From this page the user has the option of retrieving information
of their choice such as Gene Information (Fig. 2B), Chromosomal
Information (Fig. 2C), Natural Variants Information

(Fig. 2D), and Protein Information (Fig. 2E) by using four radio
buttons. These information will provide in depth knowledge
about the gene function, population studied, SNP information,
annotation, consequence of transcript, primary reference associated
with the disease and other cross references.
(iii) Classification of genes: This page displays the classification of 45
genes namely Innate Immune Receptors Genes (6), Cytokines
Genes (3), Transport Genes (1), Tissue-Specific Markers Genes
(1), Innate Immune Effectors Molecules and Serum Proteins
Genes (3), and Other Candidate Genes (31).
(iv) Associated protein studies: This page (Fig. 2F) represents other
associated proteins in different stages of leprosy namely LL, BL,
BB, TT, BT, Reversal reactions (RRs) and Erythema nodosum
leprosum (ENL).
(v) Link to other databases: This page displays two interlinked database
links which will be helpful in understanding multi‐drug
resistance in leprosy.
3. Future improvement
As the amount of genomic information generating will be increasing
drastically in the coming years, we will continuously collect the latest
gene and SNP related data disease data sets to keep up-to-date. In the
future we would like to improvise our database in three main ways.
One is to further provide link gene symbol to their corresponding accession
numbers in NCBI (NP for protein and NM for mRNA). Next is to provide
link to PDB ID information. Lastly, the incorporation of in silico tool
prediction results into database will be able to classify SNPs pathogenic
from neutral ones. We assure this information will definitely will make
a way for genotype–phenotype researches as well as pharmacogenetics
studies.
