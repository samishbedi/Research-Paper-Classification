A solution to the problem of low connection bandwidth is application of multicasting. Nowadays, multicasting has become a leading-
edge  network  solution.  It  enables  multi-point  transmission  and  collection  of  data  in  packet  mode  to/from  unlimited  number  of 
recipients/senders  in  real  time.  It  uses  IP protocol  for multicasting  packets  transmission  (containing all  types of multimedia data) by 
means  of  available  network  types,  i.e.  LAN,  WAN,  complex  networks,  the  Internet.  Multicasting  technology,  also  termed  IP 
Multicast  (Internet Protocol Multicast),  enables  practical  realization  of  large-scale  services  such  as:  interactive  news  television  (e.g. 
Business TV),  live  transmissions of financial news or meetings of board of directors, transmission of  financial data  to any, unlimited 
number of users of news bulletins (e.g. stock exchange rates from all over the world). 

 
 
Mechanism of IP Multicast technology assumes existence of  ‘multicasting groups’ (being a fundamental c oncept in multicasting), i.e. 
a  group  of  computers which  simultaneously  use  an  application,  defined  (identified)  by  a  common  (multicasting)  class D  IP  address 
[3]. Each computer can be registered as a component of selected multicasting groups.

Multicasting  is a  technology which enables organization of multi-location videoconferencing via  Internet  (MBONE) as well as  local 
and  corporate  Ethernet  networks.  Videoconferencing  belongs  to  a  subset  of  multicasting  applications  [4].  Through  its  unique  data 
transmission  method  (sending  only  one  copy  of  information  independently  of  a  number  of  recipients),  multicasting  enables  saving 
available transmission band and network bandwidth and also causes reduction in load on servers (saving computing power) and more 
efficient  use  of  available  network  resources  (Fig.  1).  This  universal  technology  is  used,  apart  from  the  two  abovementioned 
applications  using  total  multimedia  transmission,  for  data  transfer  to  multiple-recipients.  Multicasting  has  been  widely  applied  in 
business  (e.g.  software  updates  in  many  business  branches,  transmission  of  current  data  to  many  computers,  transmission  of 
multimedia  files  in  the  form  of MP3, MPEG  video  clips  etc.). Group  transmission  is  also  used  as  support  for  network  technologies 
used  for  Internet  needs  e.g.  storage,  updating  and  transmission  of  content  at  WWW  webpages  (web-cashing),  Internet  directories, 
transfer  and  automated  software  updates,  discussion  boards,  multi-person  interactive  chat,  virtual  worlds  or  cities,  virtual  reality, 
multiplayer games and others. 
 
4.2  Systems of collaborative work 
Collaborative work  is a  term which denotes cooperation of a number, geographically scattered or staying within one room, of people 
who  make  use  of  facilities  offered  by  their  work  environment  supported  by  technology.  The  support  consists  in  availability  of 
transfer  and  share  of  documents, mechanisms  for  planning  and  task  assignment,  control over  progress  in  task  execution,  tracking  of 
time and costs of the performed works.  
The purpose of implementation of rules and solutions for collaborative work might be [5]: 
• 
the need for task management and control over time and costs of realization of the tasks, 
• 
systematization and registration of document flow, 
• 
improvement in information flow between members of organizations, 
• 
need  for  integration  of  flow  of  all  the  forms  of  documents:  faxes,  letters,  e-mails,  paper  documents  which  come  from 
WWW pages or other sources. 
Mechanisms  of  collaborative  work  enable  implementation  of  an  idea  of  remote  work,  central management  and  control  over  project 
teams, regular protection of their results, systematized registration and making use of team members ’  knowledge. Collaborative work 
forces initiatives from team members, increased sense of duty and efficient time management. It can also be argued that collaborative 
work is an element of business knowledge management strategies [6].  
Data  being  in  information  circulation  in  businesses  are  mainly  scattered  around  a  variety  of  physical  locations  (servers  and 
workstations)  and  written  in  many  formats.  This  situation  is  caused  by  the  fact  that  software  from  many  manufacturers  has  been 
installed in different organizational units. Such a procedure has its effect in informational chaos which consists in lack of opportunity 
of  unconstrained  data  exchange  between  each  department  and  between  various  levels  in  a  corporate  ladder.  Incompatibility  of  file 
formats  impedes  their  processing  by  several  applications.  There  are  often  copies  of  the  same  information  in  computer  networks, 
which additionally impedes proper and quick decision-making.  
 
 
5  Model of implementation of IT infrastructure for support of multicasting 
Nowadays all bigger businesses have  their own, developed corporate networks. These networks are more or  less adapted  to efficient 
data exchange. They have  gradually developed  from  smaller networks  to  their present  state. Their  technological advancement  (from 

 
 
the standpoint of modern equipment being a part of it) is varied and a far cry from perfect. Therefore there is a need for adaptation of 
the existing teleinformation infrastructure to efficient and flexible data exchange. 
In  order  not  to  cause  work  disorganization  in  businesses  during  implementation  of  new  information  solutions,  a  model  presenting 
gradual  transformation of a network  into  the  state which enables use of collaborative work  (Fig. 2) was developed. Presented model 
is universal and is employed both in businesses with one location or having departments geographically separated from each other.

Data exchange during  implementation requires creation of specific mechanisms  for data  transformation (Fig. 3). The most  important 
component  of  the  structure  presented  in  Fig.  3  is  expert  system,  responsible  for  data  selection  in  terms  of  quality,  format  and 
adequacy.  Depending  on  a  decision  by  expert  system,  data  are  sent  to  transformation  mechanisms  or  they  are  rejected  as  useless. 
Detailed tasks of the module are to be described in further part of this work.  
Implementation  of  the model which  presents  exchange  of  information  in  local  network  connected  to  the  Internet  is  possible  only  in 
the case of adaptation of  the network  to  interactive  transmission  in group  technology. Process of network adaptation depends mainly 
on  its  initial  state.  It  can be  carried  out  at  three  levels:  network  infrastructure,  software  for  network management  and  servers within 
Intranet  networks.  Selection  of  a  level  depends  on which  part  of  infrastructure  requires  modernization.  Extreme  case  appears  when 
modernization takes place at all the levels. Fig. 4 presents next stages of infrastructure modernization in the form of an algorithm.  
 
First  step  is  recognition  of  the  existing  network  infrastructure  in  an  organization.  This  enables  selection  of  proper  level  of  network 
modernization.  This  process  is  performed  together  with  network  compatibility  test  in  terms  of  usefulness  for  IP  Multicast 
transmission.  Lack  of  compatibility  forces  exchange  of  data  exchange  integrators  (routers,  switches,  gatekeepers).  Another  step  is 
integrator  cooperation  test,  which,  if  successfully  completed,  enables  initiation  of  procedures  of  application  server  creation. 
Application servers store and make available applications used within a network, simplifying the process of management. Placing all 
applications in one location enables administrators to update them

6.6   Data Size 
 

Effective  exfiltration  of  data  places  practical  limits  on  the  transmission 
time.  The  transmitting  program,  running  on  the  compromised  computer, 
should  hide  its  activities  and  has  limited  safe  time  intervals  where  the 
collected  data  can  be  broadcasted.  Additionally,  a  receiving  mobile  phone 
does not stay within the effective range of the transmitter for indefinite time. 
In  Table  3 we  show  the  transmission  time  of  various  types  of  files, with 
typical  sizes,  when  using  raw  data  and  when  using  structured  packets  (as 
described  in  the  'Implementation'  section).  A  70ms  delay  was  found  to  be 
optimal. The  time  required  for  transmitting  tiny-size data  (below 100 bytes) 
such  as  IP  &  MAC,  or  password,  is  below  ten  seconds,  which  seems 
acceptable.  Small-size  data  (below  10  KB)  such  as  system-information  or 
one-day  keylogging  would  require  several  minutes,  which  also  seems 
acceptable. However, documents  in  the order of 0.5 MB would  take  several 
hours  to  transmit and  this would  seem  to be unacceptable. Note  that  the  toll 
inflicted  by  using  structured  packets  compared  to  raw  data  seems  to  be 
tolerable, and justifies using this method when accurate reception is required.

7.  Countermeasures 
 
    Defensive countermeasures for general Tempest threats can be categorized 
into  technical vs. procedural. Countermeasures of  the technical kind  include 
(a)  physical  insulation,  (b)  software-based  reduction  of  information-bearing 
emission,  and  (c)  early  encryption  of  signals.  Procedural  countermeasures 
include  official  practices  and  standards,  along  with  legal  or  organizational 
sanctions. The relevant American and NATO standards, concerning Tempest, 
were held highly classified  throughout  the Cold War. Some of the standards

Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALCON 2014).  

 
 
eventually leaked or were released but are severely redacted [18] while more 
informative  documents, 
in  particular 
those  concerning  defensive 
countermeasures, are still classified. The prevailing standards aim at limiting 
the  level of detectable  information-bearing RF  signals over a given distance 
on  open  air,  or  its  equivalent  when  insulating  materials  are  used.  In  effect, 
certified  equipment  is  classified  by  'zones' which  refer  to  the  perimeter  that 
needs to be controlled to prevent signal reception  [19]. As a countermeasure 
against  attacks  like  the  one  in  this  research  the  ‘zones’  approach  should  be 
used to define the physical areas inside the organization, in which carrying a 
mobile phone or other radio receivers is prohibited. Another countermeasure 
is ensuring  that only properly shielded cables are used. Shielding affects  the 
effective range as shown by our experiments.   
 
8.  Related Work 
 

Anderson  [19]  provides  a  highly  informative  review  of  emission  or 
emanation  security  (Emsec):  preventing  attacks  which  use  compromising 
emanations  (CE)  consisting  of  either  conducted  or  radiated  electromagnetic 
signals.  In  1985,  van  Eck  [11]  demonstrated  how  Tempest  exploits  can  be 
produced with rather ordinary equipment and skills. Using a modified TV set, 
he managed  to  reconstruct  an  image  from  electromagnetic  signals  produced 
by Video Display Unit (VDU) at a considerable distance. During  the second 
half of the 1990s, several researches and publications related to Tempest were 
released  [12]  [13],  spurring  increased  public  interest.  This  trend  was 
amplified  by  the  Web  which  has  offered  a  glimpse  into  classified  official 
standards  related  to  Tempest  [18],  or  provided  detailed  instructions  and 
tutorials  related  to  Tempest  exploits  [14].  Kuhn  and  Anderson  [12]  [13] 
demonstrated  that many  of  the  compromising  emanations  from  a PC  can be 
manipulated by suitable  software,  in either a defensive or offensive manner. 
Thiele  [14]  [20]  offers  an  open  source  program  dubbed  'Tempest  for Eliza', 
that uses  the computer monitor to send out AM radio signals. The generated 
music  can  then  be heard  on one’s  radio. Kania  [15] provides  a  collection of 
programs for generating FM radio signals  in software, and  then transmitting 
them  using  a VGA  graphics  card.  In  our  implementation, we  used  different 
technique to generate FM signals in order to improve the signals quality.    
 
9.  Conclusion 
 

Exfiltration of data from air-gapped networks is not a trivial task. However, 
in  this  paper  we  introduce  AirHopper,  a  bifurcated  attack  pattern  by  which 
this  challenging  task  can  be  accomplished. The  core  of  the method  consists 
of  two  essential  elements:  (a)  electromagnetic  signals  emitted  from  a 
computer's monitor cable, with data intentionally modulated on those signals, 
and  (b)  an  FM  receiver  on  a  mobile  phone  that  can  collect  the  transmitted

Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALCON 2014).  

 
 
signals,  and  extract  the  modulated  data.  The  chain  of  attack  is  rather 
complicated,  but  is  not  beyond  the  level  of  skill  and  effort  employed  in 
modern  Advanced  Persistent  Threats  (APT).  Evaluation  of  the  proposed 
method includes experimental measurements of various measures such as the 
effective  transmitting distance,  cable  type,  the presence of  receiver antenna, 
etc. 
AirHopper  adds  to  an  understanding  of  electromagnetic  emission  threats, 
coupled with APT  techniques. This  research area  is not  sufficiently  covered 
in  recent  academic  literature.  We  believe  that  a  careful  professional  and 
academic discussion of this threat, ultimately serves the interest of the cyber-
defense community.
