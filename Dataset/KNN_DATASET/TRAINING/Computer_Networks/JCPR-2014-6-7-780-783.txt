INTRODUCTION 

 
With  the  development  of  technology,  computer  technology  has  grown  to  maturity  and  become  the  hard  core  of 
China ’s  development.  We  all  use  computer  technology   in  our  life,  for  example  network  communication,  office 
software and etc.. With the help of the internet, computers computer technology to work and entertain people. When 
used  for  a  long  time,  there would  be  some  security  problems  in  computer  network  communication. Since  computer 
network  technology  has  spread  into  our  life  and  work,  these  problems  would  severely  influence  people ’s   use  of 
network  communication. To  tackle  these  usually  occurred  problems, we  need  to  establish  a  security  analysis model 
based  on  the  researches  of  computer  network  security  to  make  sure  computer  network  can  work  safely.  With  the 
development  of  computer  technology,  internet  security  analyze  model  has  already  existed.  But  the  astonishing  of 
speed  of  the  development  of  technology  greatly  reduced  the  effect  of  current  computer  network  security  as  a 
analysis model. As a result, computer network security problems occurred frequently these years. In terms of current 
situation, it is very urgent to build a complete computer network security analyzing model.   
 
2 Current situation of computer network security 
2.1 The idea security of computer network   
The  computer  network  security  we  talk  about  actually  is  the  security  of  computer  network,  security  of  important 
data  in  the  network  system  and  the  structural  completion  of  computer  network.  To  accomplish  computer  network 
security  is  to  protect  users’  data  and  computer  sys tem  from  malicious  attacks  and  steals  from  outside.  People  who 
work  on  protection  of  computer  network  security  are  technical  material  analysis  engineer  of  computer  network 
security.  They  protect  the  network  system  from  computer  security  problems  that  would  influence  the  security  of 
users ’ computers, like steal, collapse, interrupt a nd etc. 
 
2.2 Current developmental situation of computer network security 
Nowadays,  computers  are  popularized  and  became  an  indispensable  part  in  people ’s  life.  People  use  comp uter 
network  communication  technology  to  communicate with  friends,  finish works,  learn  new  knowledge  and  entertain 
themselves. The development  of computer  technology  is changing people ’s way of  living  and  improving  th e quality 
of  life.  However,  computer  network  security  still  bothers  people.  It  is  a  serious  problem  to  China  and  the  world. 
There  are  a  lot  of  computer  network  security  specialists  working  on  in-depths  researches  in  computer  network 
security.  They  have  set  up  special  researches  on  the  maintaining,  destruction  and  repairmen  of  computer  network 
security. Based on these research results, specialists built the PPDRR computer network security model. Through the

PPDRR  computer  network  security  model,  people  can  accomplish  monitoring  and  analyzing  computer  network 
security. Through the PPDRR computer network security model, specialist can detect the vulnerabilities of computer 
network system and react in time to protect computer network system from leak of information and economical loss.     
 
The  designing  of  computer  network  security  involves  a  wide  range  of  specialties.  Any  professional  knowledge 
related  to  computer  could  be  involved,  for  example  software  design  of  computer  software  development, monitoring 
and maintenance  of  software  could  all  use  the  protection  of  computer  network  security. The  protection  of  computer 
network  security  could  protect  developed  technology  and  avoid  economic  loss.  Therefore  many  computer  network 
security  specialists  work  on  the  design,  protection  and  research  of  computer  network  security,  hoping  to  find  an 
effective  method  of  computer  network  security  or  a  way  to  investigate  the  attacker  of  computer  network  system. 
Through  large  amount  of  researches,  specialists  proposed  a  new  analysis  method  of  computer  network  security-- 
“attack-tree ”. Specialists integrate past attacking  data and use mathematical formulas to represent them. This kind of 
method  is  called  “attack-tree ”.  Although  this  metho d  still  have  some  flaws  and  disagreements  in  integrating  and 
explaining the  “leaves”. Therefore some specialists
 also proposed  “privilege graph” analysis method to  improve past 
computer  network  security  analysis  methods.  In  China,  specialists  proposed  to  improve  old  analysis  method  to 
develop  new  computer  network  security  analysis  methods.  With  the  development  of  technology,  there  have  been 
continuous  innovations  of  computer  network  security  analysis  methods.  And  model  building  of  computer  network 
security  has  matured  continuously.  Although  there  has  not  been  a  specific  analysis  method  and  model  that  could 
solve  all  of  computer  network  security  problems.  But  the  way  of  scientific  is  being  continued.  Computer  network 
security model building is still being worked on.   
 
3 Influential elements of security of computer network 
3.1 Attack of hackers 
Hacker refers to people with great computer network skills but use them to sabotage the internet or steal information. 
Currently,  hackers  are  the  number  1  influential  element  of  computer  network  security.  The  main  operational 
principle of hackers ’ attack on computer network se curity is to use their great skills of computer network to enter the 
system  to  collect  data.  Then  they  use  collated  data  to  monitor  every  computer  in  the  network  system  to  find  the 
vulnerability of the network to sabotage the system and destroy computer network security system. Most hacked use 
Trojan horses and worm virus to attack users ’ compu ters. Some hackers with great knowledge base would also write 
large  amount  of  false  programs  to  install  on  users’   computers  to  control  their  computers.  Some  hackers  would  also 
monitor  user ’s  internet  data  to  steal  users ’  accoun t  numbers,  passwords  and  bank  savings.  Users  would  have  great 
loss. In order to protect users’ personal informati on and avoid malicious consequences, we need to set up a computer 
network  security model  to monitor  internet  security.  There  would  be  threats  like  communication  threat,  application 
treat  and  system  threat  in  hackers’  attack.  Communi cation  attack  refers  to  the  situation  that  users ’  i nformation  in 
communication  is  required  by  a  third  party.  Application  threat  refers  to  that  in  the  working  process  of  computer 
network,  because  of  programs  leaks  users’  informati on  is  leaked  to  hackers  and  creates  loss. System  threat  refers  to 
the threat where system vulnerability resulted in hacker attack.     
 
3.2 Software system and vulnerability of network system 
In  computer  network  security,  vulnerability  of  network  and  software  is  the  second  influential  element  of  computer 
network  security  after  hacker  attack.  Vulnerability  of  computer  network  and  software  includes  vulnerability  in 
computer  system  and  software  design,  lack  of  protection  of  computer  network  and  software  security,  illegal  users 
enter  users ’  computer  through  computer  network  vuln erability  and  computer  being  controlled  maliciously  by 
unknown  users.  This  high-risk  vulnerability  could  severely  influence  user ’s  daily  use  of  computer  and  normal 
network  communication.  It  would  cause  users’  inform ation  cannot  spread  and  receive.  With  this  high-risk 
vulnerability,  computers  could  be  attacked;  information  could  be  stealed  any  time  by  any  unkown  people.  It  would 
directly influence the security of computer network system and cause great loss.   
 
3.3 Falsification of users ’ personal information an d leak of classified information 
Falsification  of  users ’  personal  information  and  le ak  of  classified  information  is  the  third  element  of  computer 
security.  In  the  whole  process  of  computer  network  communication,  information  got  spread  the  most  is  personal 
information  of  users  and  classified  materials.  Therefore,  we  must  pay  special  attention  to  the  protection  of  users’ 
personal  information  and  classified  materials.  Falsification  of  users ’  personal  information  refers  to  the  action  that 
with  the  transfer  of  users’  information,  a  third  pa rty  intercept,  falsify  and  delete  the  information  to  result  in  the 
interception  and  steal  of  users ’  information.  Leak  of  users’  information  refers  to  unknown  personnel m onitor  users ’ 
computers  remotely  and  steal  information  through  computer  network.  Illegal  transfer  of  users’  informat ion  refers  to 
the  illegal  steal  or  borrowing  of  information without  the  acknowledgment  and  permission  of  user meanwhile  create 
loss.  Nowadays’  society  is  a  society  of  technology  development.  The  universal  use  of  computer  technology  has  a 
great influence on people ’s life. Computer network  technology has influences on people ’s life, economy  and politics. 
But  this  kind  of  influences  is  two-sided.  There  are  good  influences  and  bad  influences.  Computer  network

technology  brings  people ’s  life  convenience  and  thr eat  to  the  security  of  personal  information. This  vulnerability  of 
computer network security brings a lot problems and cause the users of computer network great loss.     
 
4 Nature of security of computer network 
Security assessment of computer network security is based on the analysis of users ’ computer network s ystem. Main 
functions  are  monitoring  whether  there  are  mutations  in  computer  network  system  and  software.  It  requires  a 
convenient, flexible and complete model to process the analyzation to avoid the complexity of space system.     
 
4.1 Need of security of computer network   
The  need  of  security  of  computer  network  is  to  fulfill  users’  requirements  of  computer  network ’s  integ rity  and 
confidentiality  during  the  usage  of  computer  network. Through  a  complete  systematical  security  strategy,  computer 
security  is  insured.  The  strategy  of  security  of  computer  network ’s  usage  can  help  computer  system  to  judge  users ’ 
process  of  usage  to  prevent  unknown  attack.  It  can  also  insure  the  system’s  main  movements  could  reach   the 
requirements  of  computer  network  security.  With  different  computer  usage,  the  need  of  computer  security  nature 
could  be  divided  into  different  risk  level  based  on  the  use,  in  order  to  protect  the  security  of  computer  network  and 
analyze specific security feature based on specific requirements. In practical use, computer confidentiality risk levels 
are shown in table 1.

Read arbitrary files or system privilege configuration file content monitoringnetwork activity 

 
From  the  table, we  can  see  that  every  level  are  rather  separated  but  also  connected  to  each  other. Every  level  could 
be  regarded  as  a  kind  of  users’  requirements  of  com puter  security.  This  is  the  separated  part.  They  do  not  conflict 
each  other. When  unknown  personnel  attack  the  computer,  after  the  security  feature  is  destroyed,  other  risks  would 
appear.  Different  levels  of  security  vulnerability  would  influence  the  occurrence  of  risks.  That ’s  whe re  they  are 
connected.     
 
4.2 Threats the security requirements are facing 
Different professions have different requirements of the security of computer network system. The protection ranges 
are also different. Specialists put the relationship between security requirements and different threats into table 2.

Through  table  2 we  can  see  that  system  threat,  communication  threat  and  application  threat  are  the most  influential 
factors  of  users ’  security  of  computer  network.  Sys tem  threat  appears  when  computer  network  system  itself  has

vulnerability  like  Trojan  horse,  backdoor  programs  and  system  leak.  Communication  threat  would  appear  when 
computer  network  communication  is  monitored  and  intercepted.  Application  threat  would  occur  when  system’s 
programs create problems like IIS, FTP. Therefore, analyze an effective way of attack and attack result are the main 
elements of improving computer network security.   
 
4.3 Access permission 
In the actual use of computer network, system could be set to give different users’ different levels o f access. Foreign 
counties  have  analyzed  this  kind  of  usage  carefully  and  designed  table  3  to  limit  different  users ’  acc ess  of  the 
system.

CONCLUSION 

 
With  the  development  of  computer  network  technology,  computer  network  security  problems  happen  all  the  time. 
Therefore, people  hold worries  towards  the  development  of  computer  network  technology. Since  computer  network 
security influences people ’s life, researches to bu ild a computer network security model must be continued.
